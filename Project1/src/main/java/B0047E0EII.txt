Some people thought little Billy Epstein and I were gay, but we really took Home Ec class because that was where all the chicks were.  We learned a lot in that class - about life, our sexuality, pubescent females and food prep.  Our teacher, Ed Banapeel, was very competitive.  We sliced and we diced into all hours of the night practicing and hoping that we could all get full-ride scholarships to culinary schools.  Banapeel was certain that would elevate his program higher than the football and basketball programs combined.  He needed to find a competitive edge and one day found it on Amazon - the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  It was faster than anything we had seen before, and clean-up was a breeze.  However, the Hutzler 571 is so much more.Being adolescent males, we decided to sneak a Hutzler 571 out of the school to spend more time with it and realize its full potential.  We found ourselves in the Home Ec room at the precise moment when Banapeel's morning coffee kicked in and he made a beeline to the bathroom to lighten his load.  Little Billy grabbed the Hutzler 571 and jammed it down his pants in a flash.  We tried to make our way to the doorway without anybody noticing us, but little Billy caught the attention of every girl in the class (if you know what I mean).  As soon as we hit the hallway, we were off and running.  We knew we would get in trouble for skipping school, but we didn't care.  We had the Hutzler 571 and it was ours.  We made it all the way to little Billy's house.  We knew we were safe there because his parents both worked during the day.  His Mom was a Slinky tester and his Dad licked envelopes for the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes.  In all the excitement after we arrived at his house, little Billy pulled the Hutzler 571 out of his pants a little too quickly.  He is now a Eunuch.But our story doesn't end there.  We buried the Hutzler 571 in little Billy's backyard to avoid suspicion.  However, we had to keep burying it because several dogs and a raccoon kept digging it back up with all of the blood on it.  After little Billy had finally healed, we decided to see what the Hutzler 571 could do.  After all, we never got that chance before due to little Billy's misfortune.  As little Billy was lifting it from the ground, the dogs were all over it, so I grabbed it and threw it like a boomerang.  With amazing accuracy it went out about 100 yards and made a perfect turn and trajectory right back to my hand.  I didn't have to move.  It was just there.  Little Billy was awestruck.  He tried to do the same thing, but failed miserably (like most paper airplanes he made in his lifetime).  Not wanting him to feel bad, I told him that maybe we could play catch with it and use it like a frisbee instead of a boomerang.  Poor little Billy lost 2 fingers that day.  He was a good sport about it, but never picked up another Hutzler 571.So, I finally had the Hutzler 571 all to myself.  I took it out and continued using it like a boomerang and found my accuracy improving exponentially.  I started taking out pigeons in mid-flight and progressed to bats at dusk.  I was getting the attention of everyone on the neighborhood and crowds started forming to watch me use my new honed skills.  The crowds grew and grew even larger.  At first I was surprised to see the college scouts, but I was more impressed to learn that Hutzler was after me to found it's very own Hutzler 571 Boomerang League.  It was when the Secret Service showed up that I started to get scared.  I was afraid that old Banapeel was finally on to me and had figured out I had pinched the Hutzler 571.  That wasn't it at all.  They wanted me to go skeet shooting with Barack Obama.  Don't tell the POTUS, but he never hit a clay pigeon to save his life.  It was really me and my Hutzler 571 hiding off in the woods.","rating":5,"author":"WAM","date":"2013-04-06T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2PWV5GNRKFKLI","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PWV5GNRKFKLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Great Gag Gift","text":"Lots of fun with this as a gift, lots of laughing about it.

Plantain, a sole banana slicer was forged. Inscribed in the edge was the text \"Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. One slicer to rule them all. One banana to find them. One perfect wedge to bring them all, and without a knife slice them.\" The power was too much for mere mortals, and though they had innocent intentions, the power of perfect banana slices overcame them. One by one the mortals fell, and so it was determined: For the sake of mankind, the One Slicer had to be destroyed.It was quite by fate--and the will of a pothead--that I came across this product on Amazon. The reviews were good, so I bought it, but little did I know that soon my soul would be consumed by the ancient weapon of darkness. I eagerly awaited its arrival, contemplating the immense ease and efficiency with which I would soon be able to slice my bananas.Later that week, as I was practicing my turkey call, I suddenly heard a knock at the door. I leaped to my feet, anticipating the arrival of my beautiful banana slicer. I threw open the door, only to be greeted by a man in a gray robe. \"Do you have any spare towels?\" He inquired, \"This is my roommate's bathrobe and I already used the curtains last week.\" He forced his way in and made himself comfortable.He was a peculiar man who stood nearly seven feet tall and smelled of sweet cannabis. Shocked by his uninvited entrance, I stood there dumbly until another knock at the door shook me out of my stupor.It was the UPS man; he had come to deliver my precious banana slicer. I was about to sign for the package, when suddenly, my uninvited house guest pushed me aside and shouted with all his might, \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS!\".The UPS man looked absolutely horrified. Right as I was about to apologize, the man in robes pushed his way out of the door and took off down the street. \"That may be the strangest thing that has happened this week!\" I remarked. After asking me to sign for the package, the UPS man asked me for my autograph to give to his daughter, who was a huge fan of my turkey calling skills.Rushing inside as soon as I could, I stared at the package which I knew contained everything my heart desired. I clawed at the package, desperately trying to free the precious slicer--MY precious slicer--But the power that bound this box could not be undone. As I was clamoring for a method to unleash the power of my very own banana slicer, I was once again interrupted by the man in the robes.\"Don't open it!\" he shouted, as he barged through the door. \"The power that is contained in that box will unleash a barrage of evil that will consume all of mankind!\" Immediately after uttering these words, he collapsed on the carpet and did not come to for three days.When he regained consciousness, and the substance that clouded his mind had dissipated, he blurted out, \"Is it secret? Is it safe?\" Soon after, he proceeded to inform me of the ancient legend of this very banana slicer.\"It consumed the souls of every mortal who has ever tried to wield its power\" he said. \"The simplicity and perfection of the slicer corrupted the hearts of even the most honorable men. The ease with which it slices was far too much for this world, and soon its dark power covered the world with darkness.\"\"What can be done?\" I asked. I could feel the slicer calling to me, so I knew it was legit.\"We must return it from whence it came,\" he replied. \"Through the chasm of the Brooklyn Bridge, across Manhattan to the center of Connecticut, where the fires of Mt. Plantain still burn; the only fire hot enough to consume the slicer once and for all. It will be a long a perilous journey, not for the faint of heart.\"\"The slicer is my burden.\" I said solemnly, as I realized the sealing of my fate. Thus, I embarked on a journey that would forever change the fate of the world.","rating":5,"author":"Froyo Swaggins","date":"2014-09-12T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1R1X0TN9OS7SH","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R1X0TN9OS7SH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"One Star","text":"Too big of slices and not easy to clean.

We were not sure how we would be able to make it through the holidays with no money to spend on gifts for each other. We decided we would not buy gifts, but I love Christmas so much I just had to buy her something. My wife's favorite thing in the world is her Banana, she loves it almost as much as I love my trusty, but dull and rusty knife. I've always wanted to allow my wife to be able to slice and eat that banana but with my inadequate knife I could never satisfy her banana needs. I finally decided I would do what is necessary to get her the best gift this Christmas. So I did it...I sold my knife. With the money I was able to get the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer for her on Christmas Eve. On Christmas morning we woke up and I reached under the bed to retrieve my special gift for my wife, surprisingly she seemed to be doing the same thing. When I turned over I saw her holding a gift.\"You shouldn't have!\" I said. \"I had to...\" she replied.We opened each others gifts and I was shocked to find in the box...a knife sharpener! When I looked up to tell her, I noticed tears in her eyes as she looked down at my gift. I asked her what was wrong.\"I sold my banana to buy you that knife sharpener.\"\"But I sold my knife to buy you that banana slicer.\"We laughed and cried and this memory has kept us going through years of marriage.When we were finally able to buy another banana, my wife finally confessed, that she liked her bananas cut the other way in long strips.

The banana slicer helps maintain a consistent thickness for all the slices and provides a more even dehdration. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it would be nice if the slices were thinner.

After floundering around looking for strategies and materials that will produce smarter, more engaged students with better test scores, we went all in and ordered 20,000 Hutzler 571's so every student and staff member has one for home and school.Before we Hutzlerized our math curriculum, our students tests scores were in the toilet. The revolutionary abacus adaptor kit we developed for the Hutzler allows our students to perform math functions from simple counting for kindergarten,  addition/subtraction for primary; multiplication/division and on through square and cube roots. Algebraic, calculus, etc algothrithms are being developed.When we got our fall math test scores back we were astounded!! Our students are now outperforming the Finnish, Chinese, and Singapore students. It's just unbelievable how excited our students are about their Hutzler math program. They don't even want to use their calculators anymore.We've also totally Hutzlerized our music program. Instruments cost too much money, so now we just use the Hutzler 571 for middle and high school band. Our incredible music teacher has come up with amazing techniques and arrangements for Hutzler kazoo and percussion. Of course, our middle school boys quickly figured out how to use the Hutzler under their armpit to produce additional musical offerings. Our incredible Hutzler concerts move everyone to tears.We are continually discovering new, wonderful uses for the Hutzler 571 in the educational setting. Our school nurses now use the Hutzler as a useful device for checking students for head lice. With a Hutzler in each hand the nurse can pull back the hair and probe the nits with the pointed end. We now have the highest percentage of lice reduction in the state!! Thank you Hutzler!,To conclude, as a 25 year veteran educator, I no longer feel like a dispirited, underpaid, underappreciated grunt. Thanks to the Hutzler 571, my passion for teaching has never been better, and I'm just one of many teachers in our district thinking and dreaming up incredible new lesson plans to incorporate our beloved banana slicers!Hutzler, because of you were no longer a failing school district and we've left no kid behind,","rating":5,"author":"Alaska Educator","date":"2012-12-28T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R3IPZ77QUB7G0S","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IPZ77QUB7G0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Five Stars","text":"My daughter loves this.

The Banana Messiah is here!","text":"In the past few years I have been prescribed multiple medications for anxiety and sleep related issues.  I have seen specialist, taken stress test and have even started yoga.  My wife and I could not figure out why this sudden change in my health.  Until now!  I wake up every morning at 5am and stress about getting my morning banana perfectly sliced before I run out to catch the train for my new job downtown.  We have 17 month old twin girls and live in a small house with a ARM mortgage that is about to explode at the end of the month, but that's besides the point.  For years I have struggled to find an easy, safe and practical way of slicing those pesky bananas.  My wife ordered this for me and BAM - I can now wake up refreshed.  We had no idea that cutting banana's for breakfast could take such a toll on my health.  My family physician recommended I stay on my medication, but I think he just wants to collect the money from my insurance company.  I said \"No way doc!  I cut bananas with ease and peace of mind - and am going to live my life stress free.\"  Even on days that I am stuck in traffic for 3-4 hours trying to get to my job that is destined to fail because it's managed by a bunch of crooks that can care less about it's staff, I have my perfectly sliced, slightly brown F#$%#@ bananas!  The best part.  This F#$%# can even slice green bananas.  I got a little over zealous and tried slicing plantain with this, and it was just a little bit too small for that class of fruit.  God speed Hutzler!  You have not only made our breakfast stress free.  You have saved my life.Edit:  I have raised the star level to 5.

My dad worked at the Hutzler Banana Slicing Research and Development Lab for 30 years! He poured his heart and soul into his work trying to come up with a cure for unevenly sliced bananas! He personally, was the sole or co-developer of over 75 models during the 80's(models 342 thru 417) He died a broken man, helping to develop the perfect banana slicer that you so casually mock! When dad passed I decided to take up his work because I was determined to not see his lifelong dream go unfulfilled! I worked tirelessly, just like Dad to help make that dream a reality! Unfortunately for me, both of my arms were ripped off while testing an experimental banana-slicing prototype. I was told that my injuries could have been much worse because the prototype was programmed to seek out banana shaped objects! Anyway, I am typing this review with my nose, in the hopes that you will cease your insensitive comments  and APPRECIATE something that so many people put so much hard work and sacrifice into!

After losing the third toe, I switched to the lesser known but still highly regarded sledgehammer approach. While this certainly worked, I think calling the result \"slices\" is a bit misleading at best. And then there was the fourth toe lost....What to do? My hacksaw couldn't make a dent in them, and child services put a stop to the 4 year old using the metal bandsaw even though the re-attachment surgery was completely successful! I came on Amazon to purchase an acetylene cutting torch, but I came across this product, and the rest is history!On to the performance: now when I hit the banana with the sledgehammer instead of turning into mush it is cleanly sliced into the perfect cereal topping. No more mush and floor dirt! Since I've switched to a smaller 8lb sledgehammer the banana slicer lasts for up to 3 times before I have to replace it!Cleanup couldn't be easier. All you need is something like a toothbrush, and in less than 5 minutes of careful scrubbing between each blade it is clean and ready for tomorrow. And if it broke, you just toss it in the trash and save yourself the time, though I always sleep a little better if spend a few minutes getting the worst bits out. Then you just fill up a bucket with water and ammonia, mop the floor to remove the remnants, and then dry it with paper towels so the kids don't slip and fall. Finally, run the sledgehammer under the sink to wash it off, then lightly oil it to prevent it from rusting.This is a miracle product that has changed our lives forever. I cannot imagine an easier way to prepare a banana for human consumption. Bananas used to be a luxury item, something we ate on special Sundays when we had the time to both prepare them and make the trip to the emergency room. Now, so long as I have a spare 10-15 minutes, it's banana time!  I've even started a little side business preparing bananas for the neighbors, which to be honest is more a labor of love. Once I get the 10 ton press I'll be able to scale this up into a money making operation, as I could probably slice 10-15 bananas at once. I dream of a future where any middle-class American has access to a well sliced banana. Thanks to Hutzler, that day is a little closer.","rating":5,"author":"roger","date":"2012-09-27T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R29WVOGDOVIFV1","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29WVOGDOVIFV1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"The Great Unboxing!","text":"This product brought joy and equality to our office banana party!

See, in Soviet Germany, we have a saying, \"Slice a Banana or be buried in a shallow grave as a traitor to our Soviet Overlords.\"  We tried for years to invent something to compete with the Western Germans and NATO, and even the USA using coat hangers and razor blades.  Crude but effective.  Unfortunately, razor blades were hard to come by in Soviet Germany so alternatives were needed.  We tried to use wire thinking this would be thin and durable but we found the wires would not stay in place causing the slices to be uneven and not to WESTERN standards.  So then we used welding equipment, Steel from the Ural Mountains, and the spirit of the Soviet Bear and came up with an Industrial slicer that was about 24 metric tons but worked like a Chopin Symphony.  We created almost 1,000,000 units of this slicer before the end of the cold war and we felt that we did everything possible to make our lives full and complete.  When I saw this slicer, I felt an urge to kill myself like no other.  Even when the Soviet KGB held me in a prison of pain for 5 years, I never felt like giving up like I did when I saw this device.  So simple, and light and perfect.  I have no desire to live anymore but I still gave the product 3 stars because its still amazing.  Now, heed my words and know that in some countries, we are not blessed with technology like this and for us, it breaks our spirit.","rating":3,"author":"Hans Weinfurter","date":"2016-10-05T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R10C1IC229KRZ5","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10C1IC229KRZ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Everything I intended it to be","text":"I think that the banana slicer, which turned out to be  I expected to be exactly what I intended, is perfect.","rating":4,"author":"Dan Kauble","date":"2013-02-07T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R27RB68YEFLBIE","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27RB68YEFLBIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Useful item!","text":"Very handy to have, makes using bananas easy to prepare for all kinds of dishes.
