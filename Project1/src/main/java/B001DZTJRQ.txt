See, in Soviet Germany, we have a saying, \"Slice a Banana or be buried in a shallow grave as a traitor to our Soviet Overlords.\"  We tried for years to invent something to compete with the Western Germans and NATO, and even the USA using coat hangers and razor blades.  Crude but effective.  Unfortunately, razor blades were hard to come by in Soviet Germany so alternatives were needed.  We tried to use wire thinking this would be thin and durable but we found the wires would not stay in place causing the slices to be uneven and not to WESTERN standards.  So then we used welding equipment, Steel from the Ural Mountains, and the spirit of the Soviet Bear and came up with an Industrial slicer that was about 24 metric tons but worked like a Chopin Symphony.  We created almost 1,000,000 units of this slicer before the end of the cold war and we felt that we did everything possible to make our lives full and complete.  When I saw this slicer, I felt an urge to kill myself like no other.  Even when the Soviet KGB held me in a prison of pain for 5 years, I never felt like giving up like I did when I saw this device.  So simple, and light and perfect.  I have no desire to live anymore but I still gave the product 3 stars because its still amazing.  Now, heed my words and know that in some countries, we are not blessed with technology like this and for us, it breaks our spirit.","rating":3,"author":"Hans Weinfurter","date":"2016-10-05T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R10C1IC229KRZ5","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10C1IC229KRZ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Everything I intended it to be","text":"I think that the banana slicer, which turned out to be  I expected to be exactly what I intended, is perfect.","rating":4,"author":"Dan Kauble","date":"2013-02-07T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R27RB68YEFLBIE","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27RB68YEFLBIE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Useful item!","text":"Very handy to have, makes using bananas easy to prepare for all kinds of dishes.

The question is: was this intentionally done by the Hutzler people or are they just completely ignorant to history? Let me provide some background. Like a majority of American baby-boomer children, I grew up in a house that staunchly promoted the new post-war 5-5-3 banana cutting configuration. Of course, this refers to 5 small slices, 5 medium slices, and 3 slightly larger slices. This was developed in early-1947 as a direct repudiation of the 3-4-6 approach that was so favored by our grandparents’ generation, and had been in use since the early 1800s.  That arrangement  was created in the Russian shtetls to show the Tsar that, even though they were poor peasants, the people could still slice their bananas the way they wanted, and that they could have as many large pieces as they chose!  This turned out to be a largely symbolic gesture, though, as fresh bananas were quite rare in the 19th century Pale (and beyond).  Anyway, the 5-5-3 approach was a clean break (no pun intended) with the past. So when I saw the Hutzler 571 advertised, I assumed that this was the Millennials’ bid to take their rightful place in the banana-cutting saga.  “Finally”, I thought (using the proper mental quotes), “a generation that not only wants to leave its mark, but is doing so with a precision tool.”  Not wanting to be labeled an “old fogey”, I immediately placed an order for one.  It arrived at my door soon after, and I opened the package with trembling hands. I carefully placed it over my banana, and pressed down as instructed.  Then I stood back in horror. No! This cannot be. 1, 2, 3, 4…..18 slices!!!!  And all of about the same size.  I quickly checked the package.  Yes…it does say “Hutzler 571”. 571! 5-7-1. 13!  The ordained 13 of our ancestors.  Not 18. 13!  Hutzler: is this some sort of a scam?

Our goal is to help make them as independent as possible, regardless of how small a feat \"normal\" folks perceived the task to be.  I have an elderly gentleman with moderate developmental disabilities, coupled with advanced cerebral palsy.  In spite of this, he tries very hard to be independent, but slicing bananas is just too much for him to accomplish on his own. When the posts for the banana slicer first hit facebook, I ordered one for him. He loves it because it's safe for him to use, and it gives him an opportunity to be involved in his own day.  He gleefully slices the bananas for his own breakfast and enough for his two housemates to enjoy.  Having said that, please carry on with the funny replies.

Life was short and brutal for the  primates in the savanna, easy prey for the swifter animals, and the little band appeared near extinction. But one bold creature picked up a  slightly flattened rock, and the Hutzler #1 was born! Far from perfect, this simple prototype was primarily used for cracking open  bones for marrow, but it was a start! Generation after generation began to thrive and expand, due to the  advantages afforded them by the Hutzler #1, and gradually improvements began to be made. Hutzler #7 was best used for smashing the skulls of rival primates, #42 for slicing raisins, #111 for trimming nose hair. Hutzler 352 carved decorative figurines out of casaba melons. Some saw that as a setback, but NO! Each and every Hutzler evolution was a breakthrough, not only in technology but in imagination, they all represented  drive in the indomitable spirit that makes a man a MAN! The Miracle Push Up Wonder Hutzler, the Steamed Coffee Hutzler, the Revolving Mirrored Dance Club Hutzler, (# 389, 412, and 461, respectively). Then, the Hutzler that was to be the answer to all Hutzlers, the single greatest Hutzler ever to be seen by mere mortals! It gleamed so brightly it was hard to gaze upon, it seemed to have a form of energy pulsing through it, it was the Hutzler our race had been awaiting, the Hutzler that would make us one with the Gods themselves!

But where is 571B-B?","text":"I am, at long last, the proud owner of a Hutzler 571B Banana Slicer, which my sweet daughter gave me in my Christmas stocking--along with pages and pages of the best reviews she printed up for me.  I have wanted a Hutzler 571B Banana Slicer ever since my daughter found the reviews for it on Amazon a few years ago and read them aloud to me while I was driving.  Of course, I nearly ran off the road several times, I was laughing so hard, but we made it safely in the end without getting pulled over.  Although, if we had been, all we would have needed to do was to read a couple reviews to the cop.  I think he would have forgiven us!  Ever since then, I have wanted my very own 571B Banana Slicer--and now I have one!For Christmas brunch, my daughter-in-law asked me to make a fruit salad, and I was so excited to use my new Hutzler 571B Banana Slicer!  I made the salad the night before, but took the intact bananas, my 571B Banana Slicer, and the reviews along so that everyone could enjoy the process.  It was so much FUN slicing my bananas, although I do recommend removing all the stringy things BEFORE you slice.  It's really hard to pick little short sliced-up pieces of stringy stuff off of every slice!I have one suggestion for the Hutzler company:  You need to invent a 571B-B Banana Slicer for those who like thin slices.  These slices are awfully thick, especially for small children.  And trust me, it's REALLY HARD to slice a banana, then have to line the slices up right next to each other, move the Banana Slicer over half a slice--and slice a second time to get nice, thin slices.  You mostly end up with banana purée, which is nice if you're feeding a baby or a really old person, but not so nice for a fancy Christmas fruit salad.One more suggestion for Amazon--MAKE A BOOK OF THE REVIEWS OF THE HUTZLER 571B BANANA SLICER!  I would buy one for every single person in my family--and there are lots of us!I'm attaching photos of me proudly slicing my first banana, as well as the fruit salad with those lovely, perfect little slices of banana.

After slicing several bananas, I counted the resulting slices and found that the number of slices produced from a single round of slicing ranged from 12 to 16 slices.  I never got the 18 slices that I expected.  I had my wife try it and she got similar results.  I checked the number of blades, and consulted with a mathematician friend to confirm that the 17 blades should produce 18 slices.  Since I couldn't get it to work, I gave up on it and threw it in the drawer. Then one day asked my daughter to bring me a ruler and she brought me the banana slicer, thinking it was some sort of cool kitchen ruler.  That's when it occurred to me to measure some bananas, and lo-and-behold, bananas come in different sizes.  I measured each banana and counted the number of slices each one produced, and found that there was a strong positive correlation between the length of the banana and the number of slices produced.  Long story short, the ONLY way to get 18 slices is to start with a banana that is exactly the same length as the slicer.  You essentially have to take the thing with you to the supermarket to make sure you have the right size banana.And don't get me started on how two of the slices don't look anything like the other slices.  Somehow they end up being pointed on one side - even though all the blades are straight.  I've found this to be most problematic near the ends of the banana.  So if consistency is your goal, I don't think you're ever going to get 18 slices out of one banana from this unit.Additionally, this slicer works only in one direction.  You have to push the slicer DOWN on top of a banana that is situated on a flat surface.  If you want to slice in a different direction, you just end up pushing the banana off the table and wind up with a banana on the floor.  And if you put the banana on top of the slicer and try to slice by lifting, all you are left with are some small dents on the bottom of the banana.  If that happens to you, all is not lost. If you have a standard knife, you can flip the banana over (make sure you mark the top some way so you know you have flipped it all the way around) and use the indentations as a guide to cut pretty decent slices. This technique also comes in handy if you push the slicer only part of the way down and then lift it up again without cutting all the way through.  This can happen if you can't accurately judge the distance to the cutting board. (There really should be some sort of gauge to let you know you've sliced all the way through.)  Anyway, if you end up having to finish cutting your own slices, you avoid wasting a perfectly good banana, but then what was the point of spending the money on a dedicated banana slicer to begin with?So if all you are looking for is something that produces an unspecified number of slices of banana under very limited conditions, then this will probably work for you.  But be prepared for some frustration and a steep learning curve.","rating":3,"author":"bobf","date":"2013-01-06T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2LRDQPC425O32","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LRDQPC425O32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Five Stars","text":"Awesome","rating":5,"author":"carol ovenshire","date":"2014-08-31T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R3U42MT6PEXLL5","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U42MT6PEXLL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"More Than a Banana Slicer","text":"Whether you choose to read further or not, if you are considering a purchase of this product, BEWARE: I am firmly convinced that the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has properties far beyond those listed in the formal description.When my H571 first arrived, I took it out of the Amazon box and let it sit on the counter. Its bright yellow color makes it a novelty item and, as such, a natural conversation piece. I hoped it would brighten the mood of my home, and it did--at first.I noticed that the frequency of visitations to my home by friends and relatives spiked rapidly. Within a week, I counted some thirty unique visitors, some of whom I had never seen before. Within a month, though I am a naturally introspective man and prefer a quiet life, I was having parties on an almost nightly basis and masses of people were circulating through my home at all hours of the night.I also found myself eating more bananas. I purchased a full bunch and found that the H571 made preparing them a breeze. I put them in cereal for breakfast, salads for lunch, and banana bread for dinner. I put bananas in buns with ketchup, relish, cheddar cheese, and chili. I also marinated bananas in teriyaki sauce and grilled them with rice and shrimp. I couldn't get enough.While I was at the grocery store purchasing more bananas for my H571, I noticed a strong, hunchbacked man glaring at me. He tried to be inconspicuous by testing the firmness of tomatoes and looking away every time I gazed in his direction, but no matter how many times he looked away, his eyes kept wandering back to me.I thought nothing of it until I saw the same man in a suit, following me in town a few days later. Then I was spooked. I walked fast and he walked fast. I ran and he ran. I ducked into a tattoo parlor and he followed me in. It was a small shop, and with my luck no one was up front, waiting for prospective clients. The hunchbacked man came into the store and pointed what felt like a banana into my back.\"There's something you need to know about your H571,\" he said.\"How did you know?\" I said.He said no more. He turned me around and gave me a shove out the door. A black sedan was waiting on the street. The door opened and two more hunchbacks were inside. I noticed they all had the number 17 tattooed on their wrist. We drove to what appeared to be an abandoned armory building in a neglected district downtown.The hunchbacks escorted me toward the building, warning me not to dare make a sound.I was almost inside when, in a blinding yellow flash, my H571 boomeranged into my hand. It was glowing and no longer felt like plastic. It was supple and fluidly extended when I flicked it to the left or right.The hunchbacks were suddenly afraid of me. They kept their distance as I backed away toward the street.A yellow cab came by and I got in.As I drove away, the hunchbacks pleaded with me that I had much to learn about the power I possessed with the H571, and that they could teach me. But how could I trust them?When I looked down, my H571 had returned to its normal plastic state and I haven't been able to trigger its bizarre properties since.I'm glad I purchased the H571--I now believe it is much more than a banana slicer--and I hope to report on its exact nature in more detail as my understanding of it grows.","rating":4,"author":"Abner Rosenweig","date":"2013-04-09T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2878RVLAGISPQ","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2878RVLAGISPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Bought as gag gift and she truly LOVES IT.","text":"Bought as gag gift and she truly LOVES IT.

Banana slicer is haunted!!!","text":"A new home, a new start. That's what I thought I was getting when my husband and I moved from our home in California to chilly, dim Belmont, Maine. An ideal place to raise the kids -- Josie, 16, and Matthew, 9 -- and friendly neighbors to make every day of our small-town life worth waking up to.Alas. We purchased our spacious new home in optimistic disregard of the warnings of the townsfolk. These small towns! So superstitious! No grizzled old crone with a voice like a rusted iron gate screaming in agony is going to tell ME how to live MY life -- am I right, folks? The house was cheap, and it was exactly what we were looking for. Nothing could go wrong! Well, perhaps the skeletons of small animals we kept finding around the house should have been a clue. Perhaps the weather, which had a tendency to change from bright and sunny to horribly overcast in moments, should have made us think something was up. Perhaps even the sound of screaming in the attic, which yielded only odd scratch marks on the walls when investigated, should have tipped us off. But it didn't.In one of the kitchen drawers of our lovely home we discovered an item which I believe to be a Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. My husband was overjoyed! Finally, a device which perfectly accommodated his banana-slicing needs, apparently left behind by the house's former tenants. Let me tell you, there was a reason it was left behind. Despite my reservations, I agreed to give the banana slicer a shot. It worked very well, and sliced bananas with an efficiency yet unknown to man -- and which I believe should remain unknown.A few weeks after he started using the banana slicer, my husband noticed that he was having trouble sleeping at night. The bedroom grew deathly cold, and the plumbing rattled like it was possessed. My husband complained of terrible dreams, in which giant bananas beckoned to him from the darkest corners of his mind. I begged him to stop using the banana slicer, but he ignored me, insisting it was simply the stress of his new job. I wish I had pursued the matter, but instead I dropped it, agreeing that he was probably right. I was just being silly.When the children began to come to me with marks on their backs and arms in the shape of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I knew something had to be done, before it was too late. While my husband was out one day, I threw the banana slicer into the nearby lake. However, due to its plastic composition, it quickly floated back to shore. More serious measures had to be taken. I put the banana slicer into a box, which I then nailed shut, put into another box, shut that box with chains, and buried it in the woods 20 miles from our home. My husband would be none the wiser, I thought, and we would just have to deal with the lack of convenient banana slicing in our lives. However, when I arrived home, there was the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, in my husband's hands. When he asked me where I had been, I couldn't respond. I did not truly know terror until that moment.My terror only increased when my husband began to show signs of hostility, as if the banana slicer was influencing him in some way. He was no longer the nondescript middle-class dark-haired white male I knew. Instead, he snapped at me. He refused to speak to the children. One day, he shoved me. At that point, I knew I had lost him. However, I didn't anticipate what would come next.Months later, my life was hell. I hadn't been sleeping properly. I could hardly eat, with the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the kitchen at all times. The children had noticed my lethargy, and seemed afraid to be alone in the house with their father. As it turned out, they were right to be afraid. My husband, influenced by the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, flew into a murderous rage, and would have killed us all had I not stopped him... with the knife I had been using to prepare a butternut squash for dinner.These days, my mother has custody of the children. I have been spending my time recovering -- and hunting for the source of the evil that I now know to be the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. I've finally found it. Now, its undoing can begin, and I will finally have my life back...","rating":2,"author":"Jack Lee","date":"2014-08-30T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R3IK3KD1X0WIQ2","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IK3KD1X0WIQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Cool","text":"it's a good tool for the kitchen and I really like it and its yellow, like a banana too yea","rating":5,"author":"Mike Phlegar","date":"2013-03-29T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1AN0IYE4KG5B6","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AN0IYE4KG5B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Five Stars","text":"Love it!","rating":5,"author":"Amanda G.","date":"2016-09-21T21:00:00.000Z"}]}

When you press down on a banana, it usually doesn't go all the way through, so you have to flip it over and push each banana piece through.

I grabbed a bowl, threw in a few Hutzler banana slicers, added milk, and grabbed my spoon in anticipation. Here is where the trouble began.Not only did the Hutzler banana slicer not taste good by any stretch of the imagination, but it also sliced my voice box into 18 evenly sized pieces on its way down. Now when I speak I sound like a crowd of people at a protest all chanting the same thing (although I now do a pretty killer impression of the Yip Yip aliens from Sesame Street). This is not convenient.

We were not sure how we would be able to make it through the holidays with no money to spend on gifts for each other. We decided we would not buy gifts, but I love Christmas so much I just had to buy her something. My wife's favorite thing in the world is her Banana, she loves it almost as much as I love my trusty, but dull and rusty knife. I've always wanted to allow my wife to be able to slice and eat that banana but with my inadequate knife I could never satisfy her banana needs. I finally decided I would do what is necessary to get her the best gift this Christmas. So I did it...I sold my knife. With the money I was able to get the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer for her on Christmas Eve. On Christmas morning we woke up and I reached under the bed to retrieve my special gift for my wife, surprisingly she seemed to be doing the same thing. When I turned over I saw her holding a gift.\"You shouldn't have!\" I said. \"I had to...\" she replied.We opened each others gifts and I was shocked to find in the box...a knife sharpener! When I looked up to tell her, I noticed tears in her eyes as she looked down at my gift. I asked her what was wrong.\"I sold my banana to buy you that knife sharpener.\"\"But I sold my knife to buy you that banana slicer.\"We laughed and cried and this memory has kept us going through years of marriage.When we were finally able to buy another banana, my wife finally confessed, that she liked her bananas cut the other way in long strips.

The banana slicer helps maintain a consistent thickness for all the slices and provides a more even dehdration. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it would be nice if the slices were thinner.

After floundering around looking for strategies and materials that will produce smarter, more engaged students with better test scores, we went all in and ordered 20,000 Hutzler 571's so every student and staff member has one for home and school.Before we Hutzlerized our math curriculum, our students tests scores were in the toilet. The revolutionary abacus adaptor kit we developed for the Hutzler allows our students to perform math functions from simple counting for kindergarten,  addition/subtraction for primary; multiplication/division and on through square and cube roots. Algebraic, calculus, etc algothrithms are being developed.When we got our fall math test scores back we were astounded!! Our students are now outperforming the Finnish, Chinese, and Singapore students. It's just unbelievable how excited our students are about their Hutzler math program. They don't even want to use their calculators anymore.We've also totally Hutzlerized our music program. Instruments cost too much money, so now we just use the Hutzler 571 for middle and high school band. Our incredible music teacher has come up with amazing techniques and arrangements for Hutzler kazoo and percussion. Of course, our middle school boys quickly figured out how to use the Hutzler under their armpit to produce additional musical offerings. Our incredible Hutzler concerts move everyone to tears.We are continually discovering new, wonderful uses for the Hutzler 571 in the educational setting. Our school nurses now use the Hutzler as a useful device for checking students for head lice. With a Hutzler in each hand the nurse can pull back the hair and probe the nits with the pointed end. We now have the highest percentage of lice reduction in the state!! Thank you Hutzler!,To conclude, as a 25 year veteran educator, I no longer feel like a dispirited, underpaid, underappreciated grunt.

As an officer of the law, I spend a great deal of time on the road in my unit. Often I do not have enough time to eat so ill bring a grand ole banana for the road. Often when my stomach rumbles for potassium and substance I look to my banana with despair as I realize my duty knife will not suffice in cutting the banana into manageable road slices. Out of frustration I hook the banana to my gun belt until I feel I'll have enough time to slice it. This was a wonderful idea... Until the day I had to clear a building with a possible suspect inside. I went to draw my duty weapon but in my haste I drew the banana. Luckily I squished it hard enough that I was able to survive the situation as the unsheathed banana fired out like a projectile, dropping the suspect. Since I've acquired the the B571, this has never happened since, (thank God). Do not bring a banana to a gun fight, but do make room on your gun belt for the B571 banana slicer.","rating":5,"author":"Deputy's Review 4 U","date":"2013-02-28T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2JYN5LLWUJWPE","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JYN5LLWUJWPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Buyer beware: only for right bent bananas!","text":"What they don't tell you is that it is only for right bent bananas - that curve like this: ((All the bananas at my grocery store are left bent bananas - that curve like this: ))It's super frustrating because I went through a dozen bananas where it only sliced the bottom halves!","rating":1,"author":"DC Reader","date":"2013-04-04T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1EWH4JB3I2MZG","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EWH4JB3I2MZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"It slices!","text":"I purchased this mostly to get even slices for my food dehydrator.

Some people thought little Billy Epstein and I were gay, but we really took Home Ec class because that was where all the chicks were.  We learned a lot in that class - about life, our sexuality, pubescent females and food prep.  Our teacher, Ed Banapeel, was very competitive.  We sliced and we diced into all hours of the night practicing and hoping that we could all get full-ride scholarships to culinary schools.  Banapeel was certain that would elevate his program higher than the football and basketball programs combined.  He needed to find a competitive edge and one day found it on Amazon - the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  It was faster than anything we had seen before, and clean-up was a breeze.  However, the Hutzler 571 is so much more.Being adolescent males, we decided to sneak a Hutzler 571 out of the school to spend more time with it and realize its full potential.  We found ourselves in the Home Ec room at the precise moment when Banapeel's morning coffee kicked in and he made a beeline to the bathroom to lighten his load.  Little Billy grabbed the Hutzler 571 and jammed it down his pants in a flash.  We tried to make our way to the doorway without anybody noticing us, but little Billy caught the attention of every girl in the class (if you know what I mean).  As soon as we hit the hallway, we were off and running.  We knew we would get in trouble for skipping school, but we didn't care.  We had the Hutzler 571 and it was ours.  We made it all the way to little Billy's house.  We knew we were safe there because his parents both worked during the day.  His Mom was a Slinky tester and his Dad licked envelopes for the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes.  In all the excitement after we arrived at his house, little Billy pulled the Hutzler 571 out of his pants a little too quickly.  He is now a Eunuch.But our story doesn't end there.  We buried the Hutzler 571 in little Billy's backyard to avoid suspicion.  However, we had to keep burying it because several dogs and a raccoon kept digging it back up with all of the blood on it.  After little Billy had finally healed, we decided to see what the Hutzler 571 could do.  After all, we never got that chance before due to little Billy's misfortune.  As little Billy was lifting it from the ground, the dogs were all over it, so I grabbed it and threw it like a boomerang.  With amazing accuracy it went out about 100 yards and made a perfect turn and trajectory right back to my hand.  I didn't have to move.  It was just there.  Little Billy was awestruck.  He tried to do the same thing, but failed miserably (like most paper airplanes he made in his lifetime).  Not wanting him to feel bad, I told him that maybe we could play catch with it and use it like a frisbee instead of a boomerang.  Poor little Billy lost 2 fingers that day.  He was a good sport about it, but never picked up another Hutzler 571.So, I finally had the Hutzler 571 all to myself.  I took it out and continued using it like a boomerang and found my accuracy improving exponentially.  I started taking out pigeons in mid-flight and progressed to bats at dusk.  I was getting the attention of everyone on the neighborhood and crowds started forming to watch me use my new honed skills.  The crowds grew and grew even larger.  At first I was surprised to see the college scouts, but I was more impressed to learn that Hutzler was after me to found it's very own Hutzler 571 Boomerang League.  It was when the Secret Service showed up that I started to get scared.  I was afraid that old Banapeel was finally on to me and had figured out I had pinched the Hutzler 571.  That wasn't it at all.  They wanted me to go skeet shooting with Barack Obama.  Don't tell the POTUS, but he never hit a clay pigeon to save his life.  It was really me and my Hutzler 571 hiding off in the woods.","rating":5,"author":"WAM","date":"2013-04-06T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2PWV5GNRKFKLI","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PWV5GNRKFKLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Great Gag Gift","text":"Lots of fun with this as a gift, lots of laughing about it.

Plantain, a sole banana slicer was forged. Inscribed in the edge was the text \"Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. One slicer to rule them all. One banana to find them. One perfect wedge to bring them all, and without a knife slice them.\" The power was too much for mere mortals, and though they had innocent intentions, the power of perfect banana slices overcame them. One by one the mortals fell, and so it was determined: For the sake of mankind, the One Slicer had to be destroyed.It was quite by fate--and the will of a pothead--that I came across this product on Amazon. The reviews were good, so I bought it, but little did I know that soon my soul would be consumed by the ancient weapon of darkness. I eagerly awaited its arrival, contemplating the immense ease and efficiency with which I would soon be able to slice my bananas.Later that week, as I was practicing my turkey call, I suddenly heard a knock at the door. I leaped to my feet, anticipating the arrival of my beautiful banana slicer. I threw open the door, only to be greeted by a man in a gray robe. \"Do you have any spare towels?\" He inquired, \"This is my roommate's bathrobe and I already used the curtains last week.\" He forced his way in and made himself comfortable.He was a peculiar man who stood nearly seven feet tall and smelled of sweet cannabis. Shocked by his uninvited entrance, I stood there dumbly until another knock at the door shook me out of my stupor.It was the UPS man; he had come to deliver my precious banana slicer. I was about to sign for the package, when suddenly, my uninvited house guest pushed me aside and shouted with all his might, \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS!\".The UPS man looked absolutely horrified. Right as I was about to apologize, the man in robes pushed his way out of the door and took off down the street. \"That may be the strangest thing that has happened this week!\" I remarked. After asking me to sign for the package, the UPS man asked me for my autograph to give to his daughter, who was a huge fan of my turkey calling skills.Rushing inside as soon as I could, I stared at the package which I knew contained everything my heart desired. I clawed at the package, desperately trying to free the precious slicer--MY precious slicer--But the power that bound this box could not be undone. As I was clamoring for a method to unleash the power of my very own banana slicer, I was once again interrupted by the man in the robes.\"Don't open it!\" he shouted, as he barged through the door. \"The power that is contained in that box will unleash a barrage of evil that will consume all of mankind!\" Immediately after uttering these words, he collapsed on the carpet and did not come to for three days.When he regained consciousness, and the substance that clouded his mind had dissipated, he blurted out, \"Is it secret? Is it safe?\" Soon after, he proceeded to inform me of the ancient legend of this very banana slicer.\"It consumed the souls of every mortal who has ever tried to wield its power\" he said. \"The simplicity and perfection of the slicer corrupted the hearts of even the most honorable men. The ease with which it slices was far too much for this world, and soon its dark power covered the world with darkness.\"\"What can be done?\" I asked. I could feel the slicer calling to me, so I knew it was legit.\"We must return it from whence it came,\" he replied. \"Through the chasm of the Brooklyn Bridge, across Manhattan to the center of Connecticut, where the fires of Mt. Plantain still burn; the only fire hot enough to consume the slicer once and for all. It will be a long a perilous journey, not for the faint of heart.\"\"The slicer is my burden.\" I said solemnly, as I realized the sealing of my fate. Thus, I embarked on a journey that would forever change the fate of the world.","rating":5,"author":"Froyo Swaggins","date":"2014-09-12T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1R1X0TN9OS7SH","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R1X0TN9OS7SH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"One Star","text":"Too big of slices and not easy to clean.

I was sitting alone at the end of the bar in the little cantina re-reading the instructions for my beloved 571B Banana Slicer for the enth time to be sure I would be ready to use her properly when I could finally find a ripe pealed banana.  Suddenly there was a commotion behind me.  A green bottle with two red exes came sliding down the bar and stopped right beside my Slicer. In slow motion, a man with beautiful silver hair sat down beside me and peeled back his banana.  His peel landed in the trash behind the bar in one smooth swoop.  Girls swooned all around him.  \"May I borrow your slicer?,\" he asked.  I nodded, unable to speak.  In a deep, sexy voice he said, \"I don't always eat bananas, but when I do, I slice them up even with my 571B.\"Needless to say, I joined his harem of swooning girls and traveled the world doing only the most interesting things.  I always travel with my 571B.  After all, it changed my life and made me one of the most interesting women in the world!","rating":5,"author":"Amazon Customer","date":"2012-08-21T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R21A4322WO9U0X","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21A4322WO9U0X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Freedom.","text":"Alright, there is one recurring theme about this piece of space-age banana slicing technology that I need to address: \"Does this product use metric?\".

Maybe if Amazon can get legislation passed to increase the 5-second rule ceiling to something like, oh say 20 seconds, this would be a useable product. I really don't see both sides of the aisle in Congress coming together to avoid the 5-second cliff though.Or perhaps Amazon could package it with something that can catch the banana slices and keep them off the floor...like a table, or counter-top or something like that. Solve this issue and you're talking about a 5-star product here!Until then, I guess I'll just have to make the kids kneel on the floor and catch the banana slices in their mouths as they fall.

I found myself eating all the right-handed bananas in my cereal while the lefties sat and browned. I'd eventually cut them up with a regular old knife and throw them in some banana bread or make some pudding.I know this is going to sound a little crazy, but my solution came through an accident. One day, while I was washing the dishes, I wasn't paying attention and my arm brushed against the Hutzler 571. I knocked it to the ground below. (THANKFULLY IT FELL ON A PADDED RUG AND DIDN'T BREAK. I MEAN, THEY ARE DURABLE, BUT WHAT A MOMENT OF PANIC!)I still can't explain it, but after it hit the ground, somehow the jarring motion switched it over. All of a sudden, I had a left-handed slicer. I immediately called my wife and when she got home, we each had 2 bowls of cereal, all with perfectly cut slices of our LEFT-HANDED bananas.Of course, then I had the same problem with all my right-handed bananas. I decided to try it again. (This time making sure it landed on the rug.) It didn't work. I was crushed, but something inside me said try again. I did. Still nothing. I tossed and turned all night.The next morning, this voice kept telling me to try the rug one more time. It was relentless. I couldn't give up.That third time, I still can't believe it, the slicer switched back to right-handed.I wondered if something supernatural had happened. But all my friends and family that I've bought these for have tried the same thing and IT WORKS! Some have used carpet in their living room, others have used bathroom rugs. My mother-in-law, who told me she'd never risk breaking it, later told my wife on the phone that she had tried it with a pillow and it worked.It isn't perfect, I'd say 50% - 60% of the time this method works. I can't explain how, and honestly I don't even care anymore.

Fortunately, or not, during my second purchase I had the foresight to consider what other essential \"upgrades\" I need just to make use of the original product.Let's just say that it all works beautifully, the banana scouring powder and polishing cloth, the peeler, the slicer, and the 13-head-rotating-banana-slicer-scrub-brush all deliver as promised, but I hope the excitement of flawless bananas on the kids' Christmas morning Cheerios is present enough from Santa this year. In fairness, the banana de-threader and banana seed extractor were probably unnecessary luxuries. But then again, were they? It's not as though I splurged on the titanium and redwood display case. (Honestly, at a quarter the price, the stainless steel and artisan-selected oak gets the job done without being unnecessarily ostentatious.)Part of me feels like we could have made due with just a cigar cutter, the appropriate violin strings, 1.25\" and 3.75\" duct tape, a repurposed loom and/or the spokes from the front wheel of a brass unicycle, a yard of bacteria-resistant crushed velvet, a baker's dozen of My Little Pony mane and tailbrushes, a set of resurfaced wooden dominoes, a pair of needle-nosed surgical-grade tweezers, and a well-trained midget. But hell, it was just one Christmas... unless the rumors about the upcoming release of Hutzer's Miracle Banana Spot Remover turn out to be true. The kids will understand.","rating":3,"author":"Amazon Customer","date":"2013-09-17T21:00:00.000Z"}]}

I received the box with such glee that I tripped on a brick step and broke my ankle. Turns out the brick was loose because of a safe deposit box key was left under it. After weeks of searching the internet (on wireless, because I had no house), I found the bank the key belonged to. In this bank, a box full of bearer bonds and a small bag of cocaine. I quickly snorted the cocaine and cashed in the bearer bonds. Today, I am a billionaire software developer with an amazing banana slicer that slices bananas pretty well. I recommend this product.

I’m a busy person and stressful, hectic mornings are not unusual to me; so taking the time out of my morning routine to ensure an evenly-sliced banana is often out of the question.Every morning I wake up at exactly 5:40 am to my Trans-Siberian Orchestra alarm, hop out of my futon and get dressed in the Pinterest-inspired pantsuit that I laid out the night before. Once I’m dressed I prepare breakfast for myself and Admiral Spikes-a-lot, my 3-month-old cactus that I’ve attached googly eyes to. And, well, that’s when my mornings become complicated. I’m often faced with the Sophie’s-choice-esque decision between suffering through the packing-peanut-crunch of plain, off-brand Cheerios or spending the necessary time to properly slice and distribute my banana into my breakfast; a feat that always leaves me three hours late for work at my terriers-only dog groomery.However, thanks to this innovative product, I have been able to add a perfectly sliced banana to my cereal EVERY DAY with ease, as well as only a 0.1 – 0.2 mm margin of error. I now have so much time in my morning routine that I have begun to take up knitting! I have so far made infinity scarves for eight of my eleven garden gnomes! The only complaint that comes to mine is that I can only purchase a 10-inch slicer online when many of the bananas I encounter at my local grocer are much more varied in size- I’d love some smaller and larger slicers as well so that I can have more variation in my banana sizes at breakfast. Other than that, this product has been a life saver and I have recommended it to everyone I know!","rating":5,"author":"a.noakes","date":"2015-12-03T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2GP675YHCZV0D","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GP675YHCZV0D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Almost Perfect...","text":"I was very excited when my banana slicer came in the mail as it was the perfect gift for this old dinosaur I know!

This got the attention of some other passengers and then a flight attendant. Upon viewing the Hutzler Handiwork (as I call it), the lame flight attendant yelled out \"BANANA TERRORIST!

I only purchased it just for the very sole purpose of being able to write a review. Besides being the coolest white elephant gift giver, I also became quickly known to my townspeople as 'the Woman who slices perfect bananas.' Its a very well respected skill in my town.This product also has helped me eat more bananas, shop for bananas every 3 days to keep them in the perfect stages of ripeness and the shape for my tool which in turn gave me purpose in life. I also gained a few pounds with the extra sugar and it seemed to go to my booty , so this product is also a booty enhancer, wow, who knew?My experimentation in bananas has lead me to make banana fosters and that has brandy in it to flambé' so I also keep brandy in my house and that makes me warm and happy too. I like bananas and liquor. I like to use my slicer in the mid morning when the sun is just peeking Into my kitchen windows ,after my coffee ,before my lunch....I peel a banana, slice it in one easy push down of the tool, then I think...self? what should I do with these even, yellow slices? Then I brainstorm ways to use the slices in sandwiches, smoothies, rice cakes, on toast, in cereal,in oats, in my foster or in the freezer for later days. It's endless.I don't have a pet monkey but this slicer has opened my mind to the idea.","rating":5,"author":"Summer","date":"2014-12-21T22:00:00.000Z"}]}

When I was deployed in 2006, it took only the HBS. (army slang for the Hutzler Banana Slicer, we like our acronyms) See, there was much frustration between the Afghan Army and we US advisers. Acrimony reigned due to cultural differences, misunderstandings and a general feeling of malevolence. However, after eating 3 day old naan, and drinking yet another cup of over sweet, very weak chai tea, my Afghan hosts were about to slice a banana for desert.  I stopped them, and motioned to my ruck sack, where I withdrew the HBS and promptly, yet expertly sliced their bananas.  Amazed and appreciative beyond words,I was quickly accepted into their clan, and we were able to chase the Taliban out of our area of operations in a newly unified and allied operation. It wasn't long until President Obama announced that the surge troops would be withdrawing and all combat forces would be leaving by 2014.  Coincidence? I don't think so.

It is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON WIRELESS. You can try using it with Verizon Wireless, but not all of the features will be available. Unfortunately, the only VW-compatible product, the Apple iSlice, is not at all designed for bananas. For $29.00 you can buy a conversion kit, but that's a crude way to go.There are rumors that the HZ571 can be hacked, but I've had loads of experience with this and can't figure a way to hack this one. I've also heard Hutzler is working on a Verizon Wireless compatible model, but that's completely unconfirmed. A YouTube video of a Verizon version appears to be faked.If you really need a good banana slicer but have Verizon Wireless, you should go ahead and buy.

But instead of salvation, the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has brought me nothing but bitter frustration and despondency.Before I go any further, I would like to voice my objection to the obviously euphemistic and wholly inappropriate product description on the Amazon page - \"Kids love slicing their own bananas\".  Really, Hutzler?  You left out, \"Nudge, nudge, wink, wink!\"  Shame on you.Now, I should point out that I have benefitted from other banana-assistive technology.  I have been using the Apogee Banana Peeler BPX52Z for several years.  But this product, effective as it is, as far as it goes, leaves the user with a still-intact fruit dog.  What to do?  So, after years of having to throw away hundreds of unsliced (and therefore, obviously inedible) bananas, along comes Hutzler to the rescue.  I knew I must have this technological marvel, no matter what the cost.After months living a Spartan existence and saving every penny, I finally amassed enough money to cover the purchase price.  When the box finally arrived at my door, I was so elated that I kissed the UPS driver.  On the lips.  Needless to say, I was happy and excited.  I was glad to get my banana slicer, too.After gleefully tearing through the packing materials, I was shocked to discover that my 571 came with no, I repeat, NO instruction manual.  How the hell am I supposed to figure this out myself?!  Hey Hutzler - not everyone is a University of Phoenix graduate, you know?Fortunately, my next door neighbor has a Spider monkey, Peanut, who was able to demonstrate proper operation of this device.  So, great - all that ends well is well, right?  Not this time.As mentioned, intentionally or not, no instruction manual was included.  Nonetheless, I've mastered the slicing procedure (thanks to Peanut).  But now, how do I get the freshly-sliced fruit disks from the plate to my mouth?  I've asked Peanut to show me, but he always puts them in HIS mouth, which does me no good.Does Hutzler also offer a Banana Slice Plate-To-Mouth Guidance System?  It is simply cruel to take people half-way there, and then mock them by leaving them helplessly staring at a plate of sweet (I can only assume, of course) slices.By proffering the 571 Banana Slicer, is Hutzler truly attempting to help humanity, or is this nothing more than a sadistic joke, meant to exploit the limitations of human cognition and perseverance, and the fragility of emotion?  Are they part of some nefarious collusive plot, along with Apogee, to drive the human race mad, one banana lover at a time??So what's your deal, Hutzler?  What other instruments of torture do you brutes have in that treacherous treasure trove you call a product line?  Bottomless mugs?  Pencils with erasers on both ends?  Hornet-filled piñatas?  You vicious bastards!While I am grateful for the new relationship that has blossomed with Carl (the UPS guy), no other good has come of this purchase, and l feel Hutzler needs to make this right, not just for me, but for everyone.To all other victims of this mean-spirited chicanery (Chiquitery?), if we do not soon receive satisfaction, I suggest we file a class action suit, to \"peel\" away the façade, and expose the conspiracy.  This isn't a banana republic.  This is America, dammit!  Let the revolution begin here...Now, then...were the manufacturer to see their way clear to send me one of those Banana Slice Plate-To-Mouth Guidance Systems for free (WITH INSTRUCTIONS), I'm sure we could put all this ugliness behind us.

She was really quite good at it.  Standing at her side over the course of years, I learned how to make everything imaginable: homemade pastas, bisques, pies, pizzas, breads, stews, you name it.  I have a distinct memory of being in the grocery store with her when I was about ten years old.  With my little hand resting in hers, I gazed at the produce while she filled our cart with fresh ingredients for the evening's meal.  My eyes rested on an odd piece of fruit (I think?) that may well have been the only thing in that produce section that we had never brought home to our kitchen before.\"Ba...banana...?\"  I read from the sign in a haze of confusion.  The instant the words left my lips, I felt my mother's hand release me and pull away as if I had just burst into flames.Her eyes narrowed and became cold and terrified. \"What did you just say??\" she said with a crack in her voice.I repeated the dirty word.  She turned white and told me to never say it again.  My heart was pounding.  I knew that I would never say it to her again.The next several weeks were awkward.  Clearly I wanted to know the story behind those hideous and terrifying fruits, but judging by what happened in the store, it would probably kill my mother if I brought it up again.  We worked silently in the kitchen.Finally, things thawed out.  We started having fun again, talking and joking around like we used to.  That is, until the day that mother keeled over while pulling a roast out of the oven.  It was all such a blur: my screaming and crying while daddy frantically called the ambulance, the medics pulling the roast off of mother and whisking her away on a stretcher.  The next thing I knew, I was holding her hand again, this time while she lay in a hospital bed.Hooked up to so many machines, barely able to speak, she mostly just gazed at me with her kind eyes.  The doctors told us that she had a heart attack and just needed some rest.\"Mary,\" she said.  \"Yes mother,\" I responded.  \"I think I owe you an explanation...\"She went on to tell me that in all of her years of mastering the culinary skills, there was only one food that she couldn't conquer: the banana.  She told me that she once spent an entire week trying to make a banana creme pie, but could never figure out how to slice the banana in perfect uniform slices.\"I wasted so much food, angrily throwing each attempt in the trash.  Your father got so mad at me for spending his paychecks so foolishly that he almost left me.  At the end of the week, I...\" she choked on the words.  \"I almost killed myself.\"The machines in the room started making all sorts of scary sounds.  Her color changed so drastically in an instant.  Doctors and nurses rushed in.  Her grip on my hand only got stronger.\"Mary!  Please!  You have to figure out the banana.  Do it for me!  For me!\"  And with that, she released my hand.  She was gone.After years of therapy, I finally started cooking again when I got married.  My husband was delighted upon discovering the talent that I had kept so secret.  Thankfully, bananas never came up.One evening, we invited my husband's boss over for dinner.  I planned a brilliant menu and everything came out perfect.  At the end of the meal, my husband beamed at me.  \"Thank you\" his eyes seemed to say.  His boss eyed us approvingly.I brought out dessert: an exotic fruits salad with almond shortbread cookies.  The men clapped and cheered and we all ate hungrily, even though we were already full.  I felt alive for the first time in years.\"Well Mary, you've really outdone yourself!\" my husband's boss chirped cheerfully.  \"One thing, though...How can you make a fruit salad without bananas?  My mom ALWAYS put bananas in our fruit salad.\"My heart sank.  I felt like throwing up everything I had just eaten.  The silence in the room seemed to last an eternity and turned into a painful ringing in my ears.  My face burned and I could see that my husband was blushing furiously, too.  I knew that the evening was over. After some very awkward chit chat and some obvious excuses, our guest of honor was heading for the door.  The next day, my husband was fired.Night after night I could feel my mother's piercing stare, and whenever I managed to fall asleep it was only to hear her last words repeat over and over:  Figure out the banana!  Do it for me!  For me!  For me!  For me!\"After a couple of weeks, I thought I was really going to lose my mind.  I was totally alone in the world, as my husband had turned to alcohol and refused to talk to me.  I finally decided to get online and reach out.  Surely someone else had had a problem like mine?After a series of failed google searches (dead mother haunting me about bananas, husband fired because of no bananas in fruit salad, bananas *comma* suicide) I managed to enter something that yielded an amazing result.  I managed to stumble upon the amazon page for the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  I savored every customer review while hopeful tears streamed my face.  It seemed to good to be true.  With shaking hands, I placed my order.The next step was far more terrifying.  I went to the grocery store and bought a bunch of bananas.  Their flesh felt so scary against my skin.  Was I really doing it?  I felt ashamed as I handed over a hundred dollar bill and ran out clutching the bananas, too scared to wait for my change.Finally, it arrived.  Nothing broke my focus as I carefully unpeeled a banana and placed the device over the fruit.  I held my breath and closed me eyes, pressing down.  When I opened my eyes I couldn't believe them.  The enigma that lay before me moments before was now a perfect pile of banana \"coins\".  Peace, at last.I baked the most beautiful banana creme pie that day and delivered it to my husbands old boss.  Within the week he got his old job back.  We owe everything to this amazing product.

I placed the banana cutter over the banana and started pressing down, gently at first, then harder and harder as my confidence improved in leaps and bounds. Just like that, I was through the banana. I let out a little gasp. It had felt so good!I quickly peeled another banana and sliced right through it. Then I sliced another . . . Then another. Soon all the bananas in the house were sliced, but I wasn't ready to stop. I had to slice more bananas. I went to the store, intent on buying a couple bananas to fuel my new addiction. When I saw all those bananas, I couldn't control myself. I started opening them and slIcing them right there in the store.Needless to say, I was asked to leave by a clerk who gave me a knowing look and muttered \"banana slicer got another one\" as he ushered me out the door. I rushed to the fruit stand and bought every banana they had. When my fiancé got home work, he found me frantically searching through a large pile of banana peels in hope is missed a banana.I gave this banana slicer 5 stars because it works as advertised.

The Hutzler Banana Slicer (HBL) is a dream come true. (Hutzler, why did you wait so long?)This beautiful product--it's yellow, just like bananas!--slices an entire banana in a single stroke. If you were to slice the banana with a knife, it would probably take you an extra 10 seconds to do it. Also, let's say you want to slice only half of the banana. You can cut it in half with the knife and then slice one half with the HBS. And the next day you'll have the other half to eat! (Just be sure to put the second half into the refrigerator right after you slice the first half because the second half will be too squishy-gooey for the next day. Who likes to eat squishy-gooey banana halves or slices? I sure don't.)I'm giving the HBS only 4 stars, though, because of what is a major drawback--for me at least:  I like my banana slices to be about 1/5th inch wide. The HBS slices your banana into pieces that are 1/4th inch wide. The 1/5th inch width slices look much nicer on top of a bowl of granola. Perhaps more important is the fact that eating 1/5th inch slices is easier on your digestive system, not to mention how gobbling down 1/4th inch slices makes you look like a starving pig. Think about it. You know I'm speaking the truth.Bottom line?  Well, do NOT let the slice width keep you from using the Hutzler Banana Slicer. If you don't buy one, you won't possess what surely must be the finest banana slicer on the market. Heck, it might even be the only banana slicer on the market.

The description does not say so, but the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, unlike other Hutzler BS models, lacks iPhone integration.Not sure if this was just a design oversight, a deliberate effort by Hutzler to marginalize Apple's profits, or just a reflection of the natural animosity between Apple and Banana.At any rate, after multiple calls to the Hutzler I.T. department went nowhere (high call volume), I came up with my own work-around.  Here's what you need to do:1) Balance the two ends of the 571 Banana Slicer on two soup cans.  (Campbell's \"Double Noodle\" works best -- Do NOT use Minestrone)2) Place your cereal bowl between the soup cans.3) Place peeled banana on top of the 571 Banana Slicer.  (Banana MUST be pre-peeled.  Will NOT work if you wait to peel it later, per my results on several tries!)4) Place iPhone flush with the 571 over the banana and apply downward pressure, uniformly, keeping the iPhone flat.If you do this correctly, the banana will be forced through the 571 Banana Slicer by the force of the iPhone.  Many of the slices will land in your cereal bowl.  Switch your iPhone to the \"spoon\" app and enjoy!This work-around makes the 571 usable despite the lack of iPhone integration, but all in all it may be better appreciated by those with smart phones running Android.The 571 is still worth every penny, even for iPhone users, since the technique above will allow you to get perfectly sliced bananas with a lot less pulp sticking in the grooves and buttons than the \"old\" way of slicing bananas with your iPhone.","rating":2,"author":"TKO Man","date":"2013-04-11T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2MIHPKRTN24NM","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MIHPKRTN24NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Waiting for bananas...","text":"So excited!

I soon became captured by a hostile tribe of natives, and was sure I was going to become that day's lunch.  I searched my pockets for whatever trinket I might find to buy myself a little time, when I found my Hutzler 571 Banana slicer.  I set up a makeshift demonstration table on a large tree trunk and demonstrated to the tribe's elders the amazing symmetrical banana slicing capabilities of this wonderful device.  fortunately for me the ancient scrolls had predicted that one day a bald, fat, white man would appear with impeccable banana slicing skills and would deliver the tribe from their shabbily sliced banana woes.  I was swept up on the shoulders of the tribesmen and immediately worshiped as a deity.  Unbeknownst to me, there had been a great division in the tribe between those who sliced bananas longways with a machete, and those who squished them up into little balls and served them that way.  I had brought the tribes together and avoided a bloody civil war.  Small children sang ballads about me.  After a few weeks, I made the difficult decision to leave the tribe and find my way back to civilization.  I left the banana slicer at the elder's doorstep and snuck away in the middle of the night.  For three weeks, I battled snakes, leeches and the occasional jaguar to find my way out of the jungle.  The worse part of the ordeal was having to survive on unevenly shaped banana slices.  I have now made my way back home and will definitely be ordering myself a second Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.","rating":5,"author":"Robert Clements","date":"2013-02-08T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R28AHMDZ753QFL","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28AHMDZ753QFL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Two star!","text":"Not so good.Lightweight and waste of my money.","rating":2,"author":"Gail M.

We had tried counseling, but found that there is NO ONE out there who understands this marriage-killer. \"Lighten up! Does it really matter if the banana slices are perfect?\" they would flippantly ask. Or, worse: \"Isn't your marriage worth spending 10 seconds slicing a sticky banana with a knife?\" We could find no help anywhere, and we knew the problem was only going to get worse with time, as we entered our golden years and had to eat more and more bananas to keep our potassium levels up.Well, thanks to all the great reviews, (especially the one from KRWE30 with the very relevant rhetorical question of, \"what's the point of even getting married if you can't find a quality banana slicer?\"), I decided to check into this new device. I sought advice from trusted friends, and with the support I got from them, I approached my husband.

The bananas were either too big or too small, or their curvatures were far off from that of the 571. There was nothing I could do to get full, even cuts of a Dole or Chiquita banana. I tried off-brands from time to time, but they, too, never fit.And then I said to myself, \"Hey, this thing fits in my pocket.\"On our next trip to the supermarket, I went over to the banana display, pulled out my trusty 571, and held it up to each individual banana so I could pick out only the ones that fit the form factor and would therefore slice up fully and evenly. Other shoppers were getting annoyed that I was pulling individual bananas off the bunches, but when I explained what I was doing everyone seemed to back off and just let me do my thing.Now, every banana we take home fits perfectly in the Hutzler 571!

Irregular and lumpy, the slices just didn't make the mark. Gurtzenhulu, (my son,) frustrated by the ugly fruit, once slammed down his book, sending the Hutzler flying from between the pages. It hung in the air, rotating as though suspended, before coming down perfectly upon a peeled banana sitting on the cutting board. As if by magic, seeing the 18 perfect pieces lying there, framed by the yellow cutting tool, we gasped as though struck. It was my wife, Marphlezik, who screamed first.\"Banana sliced perfectly, oh my gracious gracious gracious gracious, oh my!!! Peabody, come and lookeee!!\"  She called to our daughter.  Peabody come a runnin' and we marveled at the wonder of it all. \"Oh muh gawd, purty little slices sliced like slices!\" Peabody gurggled, stuffing each banana partition in her slotted, barely toothed mouth.

You see, I... am a slice addict. As you will see, I was among the greatest and most profligate banana slicers in the world. My slicing was legendary. I sliced with John Belushi, Lindsay Lohan, R Kelly, George \"Cowboy Banana Cowboy\" Bush, Barack \"Slicedaddy\" Obama, Keith Richards-I once sliced with Chris Farley for 60 hours straight. I was living the high life, until it all came crashing down around me.You see, for years, I was lost in a morass of banana-slicing impotence, aimlessly wandering through life obsessed with finding the perfect banana-slicing instrument. A simple google search yields thousands of competent and admirable banana-slicing products and methods, or b-slizzle as we slice addicts call it, but none measured up to my expectations of banana-slicing grace. I was a substance addict, my tonic being a soft, smooth, perfect banana slice. At first, it was a simple hobby. Like most of you, I would spend no more than five or six hours a day slicing, displaying, posting on facebook, and then consuming. Of course it's probably obvious to most of you now that for those of us with the sliceaholic gene, this level of slicing is not near enough to satiate our desires and can only end up in disaster. But being a true addict, I was blind to the pain I was causing others and deaf to the warnings of friends, family and activists. I ended up hurting those who love me the most: kids, grandkids, wives, parents, and my pet hedgehogs. It got to the point where I would stay awake for days straight pushing my bananas through the strings of my guitar and then shaking them out of the hole or shoving bananas through the chicken wire surrounding my hedgehogs. But the banana slices, magnificent as they were, would inevitably end up getting eaten by the hedgehogs or tasting like guitar. From there I began to explore new and dangerous slice methods-methods that would connect me to both the glamorous side of b-slizzling and the deadly underworld of slice addicts.A typical day for me would begin at the banana factory, trading sex or drugs or cash for a fresh batch of newly-minted bananas. Green, yellow, brown-it mattered not. It was all about the slice for me, as any slice addict can attest. From there I would cruise the whittling district with nothing but a knapsack or barrel full of bananas and a bowie knife, selling my flesh to knife artisans for their crafting of slices. But still, the bananas were sliced only to near-perfection, leaving me craving more and better slice every time. I had already been kicked out of every Japanese restaurant from Houston to Chicago for throwing bananas at the chefs to cut in the air. In my insatiable lust for the smooth sensuality of fresh banana slices, I was blind to the racial insensitivity of this practice. I cannot even begin to count the number of kids around town whose bicycles I stole, just to feed my lust for the reckless and dangerous practice of spoke-slicing, or \"splicing\" as we call it.As I found newer, more efficient-and often ruthless-slizz techniques, I became more and more careless and violent, but still, it was ever enough. I was arrested at home furnishing stores for pushing thousands of bananas through their window blind displays (blindspotting). I was walking around day and night wearing nothing but multi-blade ice skates just to slice the thousands of bananas littering the floor of my home and yard at any given time (figureslicing). I can't tell you how many poor hedgehogs I killed or maimed because of those shoes. I wasted tens of thousands of dollars on designer grade electric and solar-powered fans with razor-sharp blades to accommodate the immense volume of slicing I was pushing on a daily basis (blowing). I always tried to use solar fans to reduce my carbon footprint.Of course this enslaving lifestyle could not be sustained forever. My picture was on the wall of every Benihana in the southwest. Children all over the state had replaced their traditional spoked wheels with solid spokes, and the motocross bullies would turn their bikes on me and beat me senseless when I would stand alongside the supercross track shoving b into their frenzied wheel-spinning (motoring). On October 3rd, 2007, I had hit rock bottom. I had just slizzed with Sean and Biggie in the Hamptons (he's still alive, turning tricks for b in the banana underworld). I awoke from a potassium coma to find my bank account, formerly over twenty million dollars, completely dry. Everybody talked about the housing and equities markets crashing, but let me tell you, the crisis hit the slicers bad!. My credit cards were all cut off, and my lines of credit with the banks and various banana slicing venture capitalists were dry. And the hedgehogs had revolted in a bloody uprising, known as The Bloody Hedgehog Uprising.As I write to you today, from the comfort of my humble country cottage, I do so giving grace to god, with sorrow and gratitude to those whose lives I crushed and those who stood by me through all the finger cuts and slipping on peels. I have found a tranquil peace, all thanks to the hundreds of amazing, beautiful people who made the H-5 a reality.I will skip the platitudes so pervasive in all the reviews of this magnificent product and cut to the chase. CUT TO THE CHASE. That's what the H-5 does. I call it the H-5 for short and because H-5 sounds almost as awesome as the H-5 is. Who knew that I could find peace from such a complex, yet simple, engineering marvel. You would think that I would have had to walk away cold-turkey, but for me, the game was all about the perfect slice. You see, once you find the perfect slice, your life is at peace. And that is what I have found-what I find every day-the perfect slice. Although my H-5 background check revealed to many illicit banana incidents in the past to procure one legally, I was able to receive a presidential pardon from George Bush because he knows I could blow the whistle on his falsified reports on Saddam's WMB's (Wildly Massive B-Slicers) and from Barack Obama because of the help I offered in getting Obamaslice to the socialists.So kids, understand that banana slicing is not as glamorous as all those billboards in the 70s portrayed it, and can be done in a safe and fun manner from your own home for under five dollars. I sincerely hope that the scientists and board members of Hutzler continue forward and attack similar cancers on humanity like methamphetamines, aids and immigration. So much gratitude goes to Anthony Weiner for bringing bananas into the public eye and to Fox News for having the conviction to doggedly pursue this story in hopes of bringing down the banana-controlled senate.

He knows that due to my upbringing, I've developed banana-PEELING skills far superior to most of my peers, but as we've all learned--many of us the hard way--banana SLICING is a whole different ballgame.  It's like comparing tee-ball to the major leagues, or a chicken nugget to Coq au vin.  In other words--good luck, buddy.The first thing you'll notice is that the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer looks remarkably like a banana (unlike the Hutzler 570, which was a purple dodecahedron.) The sleek new design really gives it that authentic \"banana feel,\" which is exactly what I'm looking for in a banana slicer. In fact, it looks so authentic I've almost eaten it by mistake four different times.  Whether you need your bananas sliced for cereal, smoothies, pancakes, or more cereal, the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer will help you get the job done in a \"nanner-second\"!I think one of the most intuitive features of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer (our tribe calls it the \"Hutz\" or \"The 571\" for short) is that, while it's small enough to fit in almost any standard three-car garage, it's big enough to tackle even the meatiest, most genetically modified steroid-banana.Bottom line:  If you're anything like me, you're a busy man or woman who eats dozens of bananas several times each day. The absolute LAST thing you have time for is opening drawers and fishing out knives.  The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer didn't just make my breakfast easier--it enriched my life beyond my wildest dreams.  I've become a better husband, father, and overall human being.  I can run faster, jump higher, and last longer in bed, and it's all thanks to the patented German engineering of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. If you're in the market for something that will do exactly the thing it says on the box and also turn your entire life around, look no further than the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.","rating":5,"author":"Cerebral Paulie","date":"2014-01-15T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1BZZBTG0HIQLI","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BZZBTG0HIQLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Peace, Hope, Love.","text":"Move over sliced bread!

Day in and day out, year in and year out, I bought into the lie, automating each and every facet of my life. Take, for instance, the 'simple' action of slicing a banana. For years I coveted some device that could make this begruding task simpler, and upon gaining the ranks of adulthood, I finally acquired the one tool that could provide me the simplicity I needed to cut my bananas: the Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf ShredderPatriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder. Power, speed and immortality were now at the cusp of my intention, and I knew that I had finally arrived.But with age comes experience, and with experience, wisdom. I soon realized the addiction to unleaded gasoline I had developed. The fear of being unable to cut my own bananas with such ease crept through my soul like the malignant cancer it was. Therapy was no help, and the pills did nothing to quiet the cacophony of voices screaming for sanity in my head. I began to purchase larger and larger gasoline containers in the hope that I would have enough gasoline on hand should I forget my daily trip to 7-11 for a donut and a slushie. 5 gallons became 10, 10 became 100, and soon the ATF was at my doorstep demanding the removal of the second 10,000 gallon gasoline tank I had just finished installing in my backyard (made all the more difficult by the fact that I do not support The Man by linking my domicile to electricity or water). They claimed the judge agreed with them. They claimed the city agreed with them. Fools, could they not see the predicament, nay, the impending doom that silently waited the moment when I could no longer cut My BANANAS!Living in a society so decrepit, so corrupt, so filled with its own ambition that the only possible outcome is it's own demise is not an easy thing with which to live. It was obvious to me and mine that these attempts at preparation were doomed to failure, and so the stage was set. These gasoline haters were the harbingers of the apocalypse, one which I could not avoid without endangering my own ability to cut bananas with my Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder. I slipped into depression, a black hole from which I knew no escape existed. I was destined to a life living in fear of the days when I would be forced, through sheer survival, to attempt eating a banana without it being cut. I ask the reader to forgive the vivid imagery, and I fully understand if you must leave now to quiet the wailing grief of the women and children, those who cannot bear such a thought.Behold, I have been vindicated! I have been released from such a death grip on my soul! Now, thanks to the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I have found a way to continue cutting my bananas long after mankind has ceased to suckle at the teat of fossil fuel dependence. I will preserve my precious Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the vault, where it will stand ready for all of my banana cutting needs. Gas powered appliances have their place in every modern kitchen, and the usefulness of such a treasure from the Gods will not go unused. But when it is starved to death by the inability of mankind to share scarce resources with their neighbors in need as my last drop of ethanol-laden unleaded is consumed by the death throttle of my Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder, I will be able to give it the proper burial and funeral rites it deserves. I will be able to continue on, day to day in an Armageddon wasteland filled with uncut bananas, secure in the knowledge that those whom I hold dear will still benefit from my foresight, planning, and Godgiven blessing that is this simple, handheld device. It requires nothing more than the power of my own muscle, being powered by the fruit of the cut bananas this so freely gives, and thus the circle is rendered complete and prophecy from ages past fulfilled.I wish you the same liberation and freedom that I have discovered through this technology handed to mankind by ninja monks dwelling deep inside the earth's cavernous center.","rating":5,"author":"Dave D-Dawg","date":"2013-04-04T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1P1M8YLFNZZ00","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P1M8YLFNZZ00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Oops!","text":"Boy, is my face red!

We decided on the Hutzler because it sounded more exotic and vaguely German.So, the day it arrived, we opened the package it was shipped in and easily identified the product.  That's when the fun began.  There was a piece of paper in the packaging, but it appeared to be just the packing slip.  There was not a trace of instructions to be found anywhere!  We must have stared at that packing list for an hour, passing it back and forth between us, convinced there were instruction on how to use the dang thing somewhere.  Eventually we gave up and had to learn to use it with trial and error.What a mess that was.  I will let you all in on what we learned:DO NOT try to stand the banana on end and slice it that way.  The stem will get stuck between the blades.  If you must try it this way, I suggest you get a knife and slice the stem off before using the tool.DO peel the banana first.  The blades are made of plastic and an unpeeled banana (especially a unripe one) will be horrific to try to slice with this tool.  If you must try it this way, I suggest you get a knife and score the banana peel lengthwise four times, rotating the banana as you do.DO NOT buy bananas in bunches at the grocery store. You need to buy them singly.  This is because ONLY HALF THE BANANAS IN THE STORE FIT IN THIS DAMN THING!  Look closely at the product picture; you will need to buy bananas that \"face\" to the right.  Ones that face left won't fit.  And make sure you lay them out in your shopping cart that way carefully; we have gotten home and realized that we thought we had purchased all \"righties\" but had a few \"lefties\" when we unloaded our groceries.  If you must try a \"leftie\", I suggest you get a knife and cut the banana in thirds, and then flip the top and bottom parts over so that the outcast banana appears to be a \"rightie\".Hope this helps!","rating":3,"author":"John Campbell","date":"2014-01-10T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1OXU12ZDJAVG1","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OXU12ZDJAVG1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Bought As A Joke, But It's A Good Tool","text":"I bought it to use to make dehydrated banana slices, but they are too thick when cut with this.

It may change your life, it certainly did mine!Nearly everyone, by now, is well attuned to the difficulties of banana preparation.Specifically the slicing aspect. It gets to the point where looking at a banana (or,heaven forbid, rack of bananas) can fill one with a sense of impending doom. Because you don't want to slice the banana. \"Ain't Nobody Got Time For That!\" The way I used to handle the situation, was to take a knife and... well... lets just say is was a process. Quite a number of seconds of my life down the drain! For each and every banana! I'm sure there are many who know what I am talking about.Enter the Hutzler 571.The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has been a Godsend. Now, instead of the complicated, messy, time consuming (and dangerous) knife-based preparation of my favorite yellow, slightly inappropriately shaped fruit, I can get perfect banana slices in a fraction of the time. I can honestly say this little miracle has shaved seconds off of my slicing time. Thank you Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer for giving me my life back. Now I have plenty of time on my hands to do all those little several-second tasks that have fallen by the wayside. For instance, turning off (and on) the lights, pouring milk and other beverages into a glass, putting on underwear, checking my rear view mirror before backing out, opening (and closing) the drapes, flossing my two lower molars, feeding the puppies, waving back at people, and yes, even the occasional romantic interlude with my wife. The Hutzler 571 has, quite literally, improved virtually every aspect of my life.The build quality of this product is phenomenal. All the intricate working parts are perfectly integrated. The array of slicing mechanisms are perfectly spaced and apparently self aline between uses. The Hutzler 571 is constructed of fine quality plastics and other materials. It looks like a Million Bucks! Visually pleasing to say the least; I would even use the term \"Work of Art.\" If Steve Jobs had devised a banana slicing device this would be it. (Of course the Apple version might be just a tad bit more user friendly... more on that later.) It is beyond me how they can offer the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer at this price point, high as it may be. Perhaps, in the future, they will charge for software updates (I hope not), or upgrades to the OS. Either way, don't be put off by the (seemingly) high cost, this machine is a gem and a bargain at twice the price. It might be tempting to wait and see if the price (currently at $1.29) drops by several percent, to say $1.19 or even $1.09. A substantial savings like that would be nice, but as I've said, I believe the $1.29 price to be more than fair.There IS a steep learning curve with this one. Short, but steep. It took me several days (weeks, actually) to master the techniques necessary to operate this marvel. In fact I could stand to hone my skills further which I plan to do with continuing use. Nevertheless I was (mostly) successfully slicing bananas in under a day of trial and error. Common missteps could have been avoided with an included instructional video. Or such a video, or more appropriately, series of videos, could be sold separately. At any rate, mistakes are unavoidable early on.Reading up on this and other online forums may help. For instance, try to avoid these common (rookie, ha just kidding) mistakes: attempting to slice the banana in an improper orientation (such as lengthwise or \"lefthanded\"), slicing an unpeeled or partially unpeeled banana (the pealed portion may actually slice, but at the expense of the unpeeled portion), using non-banana fruits (such as watermelons, pumpkins, or plantains), pressing down with zero force, attempting to press the banana through the Hutzler 571 onto the counter, trying to process more than one banana at a time (such as four or six at once), sending the banana through the Hutzler 571 repeated times (in some cased this can work but you have to be extremely accurate), attempting to \"turn on\" the Hutzler 571 before use (it turns on by itself AND seems to turn off a few minutes after use), slicing the banana with a knife first, and lastly (this got me quite a few times) not pounding the bananas into a smooth pulp with a curtain rod before using the Hutzler 571. I would suggest purchasing eight to ten pounds of bananas to practice on at first, until you get the hang of it. That way when the time comes should you actually need banana slices, you will not be fiddling around unsuccessfully in the heat of the moment (e.g. while your cereal is getting soggy, ice cream is melting or guests are waiting).[Edit: some have said it is possible to process plantains under certain circumstances however my repeated attempts were unsuccessful and I would not recommend it!]In closing, If I had $35.00 for every time the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer got me out of a banana slicing jam I would be a financially better off person right now, I can tell you that! But even without such hypothetical monetary stimulation, my life is fuller due to this wonderful product; and I whole-heartedly recommend the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer to any one with banana slicing needs.Now if they could just invent a device that would enable the easy transfer of butter onto bread (other than the awful knife system I use now!) ...

I am flabbergasted by the answer I got. Whilst shopping for life essentials I found this and it was a real blessing. Since I was a 8 year old in Morocco I had two dreams, a banana slicer and a banana straightener. Unfortunately the latter has still not yet been invented. But, lets go to the point of my situation. The banana slicer clearly depicts a Pale Banana PANTONE 12-0824 TPX color, the one I received is a Banana Crepe PANTONE 13-0815 and it is simply unacceptable. No refunds, no explanation, Stacey passed my call to \"Rori\" (what in the name of bananas is that name?) and he still did not solve issue nor was able to explain why we have this banana tone divergence. Word of caution for you shopper: Pale Banana will not solve your issues.

I figured if the Hutzler could provide perfect banana servings in seconds, how would it work for other foods that need sliced when served? Well, for me, meatloaf has always been a challenge, as someone always gets the primo, super-wide slice and someone ends up with a thinner than average cut. Problem solved?Not so fast.So I realized I needed to reduce the overall cross section of the loaf. OK, fine. I simply mashed and squished my meatloaf into a thinner, more-banana like tube. After I baked our dinner, I was all ready to slice up some perfectly proportioned servings for the family. Upon pulling out my perfectly-browned confection, I located it upon a cutting board.What I saw horrified me. My creation, shaped solely due to my unbridled desire to multi-task my 571B, in all its moistened browness, had transformed in appearance. Maybe, like me, you had never thought what a banana-sized, cooked meatloaf would look like.Well, I am here to warn you: Meatloaf should never look the same before you eat it as it will when your body is done digesting it. I never got to the slicing part as my appetite vanished.In summary, the Hutzler 571 is perfect for bananas, but not so awesome for cooked, banana-sized meatloaf. 3 stars.","rating":3,"author":"General Berringer","date":"2013-01-30T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"RCVQLR8QXSYM3","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCVQLR8QXSYM3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Four Stars","text":"Trust me to order the Model 570 just before they released this beauty with all the upgrades.","rating":4,"author":"ump902a","date":"2015-11-28T22:00:00.000Z"}]}

We had no idea that cutting banana's for breakfast could take such a toll on my health.  My family physician recommended I stay on my medication, but I think he just wants to collect the money from my insurance company.  I said \"No way doc!  I cut bananas with ease and peace of mind - and am going to live my life stress free.\"  Even on days that I am stuck in traffic for 3-4 hours trying to get to my job that is destined to fail because it's managed by a bunch of crooks that can care less about it's staff, I have my perfectly sliced, slightly brown F#$%#@ bananas!  The best part.  This F#$%# can even slice green bananas.  I got a little over zealous and tried slicing plantain with this, and it was just a little bit too small for that class of fruit.

As if that weren't bad enough, I have to live my fragile life with a crippling fear of Knives.. And Bananas.I have a reoccurring dream in which I am sitting at a marble dining room table with a black plate in front of me upon which sits one whole peeled Banana.I am hungry and I am not afraid. I want so badly to eat this Banana & digest all my fears but how will I ever get this weird smelling fleshy fruit of unknown texture into my tiny mouth crevasse?How can I move past my fears?The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.When I first came upon this product I was scared. I knew that color and shape. My mind reeled as I flashed back to that pasty white face and those drug-addled eyes contained within the violent Banana. So much pain.In the midst of this pain filled bitter memory I had a revelation. This was a tool of Banana Destruction!I ordered it immediately. I had it delivered overnight express. Because I am an Amazon Club member it was such a great deal!I instructed my mother to have a fully peeled Banana placed onto a plate on the marble dining room table that inhabits the \"for guests only\" Dining Room.Then I informed her that I would be staying in my room until the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer arrived.It was 1:37 pm when the doorbell rang. My mother, per my instructions, set the box next to the plate on the table and left the house. I recalled our argument the night before with sadness as I heard the front door close behind her, \"I don't care where you go Mom but you can't stay here, it won't be safe!\" A hard truth that I was eventually able to convince her of and now I was alone. The time had come.I recoiled as I smelled the violent fruit upon stepping into the hallway but this was no time for fear. This was my time. I walked down the long hallway leading toThe dining room table and sat down in front of the demon fruit. I then picked up the Amazon box and tore the taped area open with one fluid motion of unfathomable purpose. I saw struggling yellow rays of light trying to pour out from beneath the bubble wrap, so I unleashed them. And there it was. I wasted no time.I pulled the banana shaped banana slicer out of the box like a sword from stone and held it directly above my mushy fibrous victim. Then, with all the might my tiny-wired shut mouth could muster I yelled \"GERDBYE BHERNANER!\" as I slammed the slicer down into my enemy's flesh. I have to say the Hutzler 571 performed brilliantly. The slicer was the exact same shape of the banana, how did they know? I immediately grabbed a slice of the seething 'Nana and with great hopes held it up to my crippled orifice. It was a perfect fit. I slid my perfectly sliced enemy between my teeth onto my tongue and tasted the victory. It was sweet. So so sweet.I swallowed my fears one slice at a time and when the beast was gone, I was a new man.I owe my life to the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.

Mesmerized, he bought out their inventory and distributed them amongst his cast mates and film crew.  All were thrilled to be able to slice their own bananas and to do so in such a way that's great for cereal, plastic, and dishwasher safe.Producer Dino De Laurentiis immediately recognized that the \"Magische gerät das lange sanft geschwungenen frucht teilt sich in mundgerechte medaillons\" -- priced at a mere 19.99 Deutschmarks, or approx. $9.95 US (MSRP) -- could readily replace me and the Best Banana Boy (and our salaries).  Three days after we had put to sea to resume filming, the two of us were fired from the production and marooned on an archipelago 100 nautical miles west of the Canary Islands.  Fourteen years later, a passing ship found us adrift in the Atlantic Ocean, floating on a raft we had built from discarded Blockbuster Video cases which had washed ashore over the years.We returned to the United States to find a changed world: among other shocking revelations, I learned that a Communist, Haitian Muslim had been re-elected to the Presidency of the United States and, even worse, that the instrument of our demise had been rechristened \"The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer\" in honor of its inventors and the film production which had brought it to the New World, and that it had revolutionized the world of phallus-shaped fruit division.I am a man displaced in time, lacking the skills, knowledge, and experience to survive in the 21st century.  My sole trade and area of expertise -- clapperboard banana slicing -- has been diminished and rendered obsolete by a seemingly-magical piece of plastic fruit cutlery.My one hope is that I can establish a market for bananas sliced *lengthwise* with a clapperboard; I am also practicing lengthwise banana slicing using hedge shears to disassociate my present-day fruit-slicing techniques from the outdated methods of my Hollywood years.","rating":3,"author":"Dante Bacani","date":"2013-01-17T22:00:00.000Z"}]}

The 571B banana slicer requires a patch to be installed PRIOR to first use with a Windows 8 platform.After several calls with the Hutzler tech support team, I was directed to a link on the Hutzler website. I was able to download the \"Hutzler 571b patch for Windows 8 banana slicer usage (Anglais).\" It is 349mb so it took a while to download, but I was able to save it on my desktop for easy locating. I was then able to work with the fruit department tech team and jotted down some notes.Instructions:1) Go to the \"start\" menu and search for \"config.sys\" file.2) In a SEPARATE search window, manually browse your desktop for the \"Hutzler 571b patch for Windows 8 banana slicer usage (Anglais)\"3) Double click the patch file icon, when it opens, click \"disable autorun,\" then close the file.4) Going back to the patch file icon, RIGHT CLICK the icon and select \"open with\"5) Open with the notepad application.6) Scroll to line 371 and highlight lines 371 - 1114. Right mouse click and select \"Copy\"7) Going back to config.sys file opened in step 1, open in \"basic editor.\"8) When the configuration file opens, disable (ignore button) the two warning screens that pop up.9) Scroll to line 22453, and type (rem) in front of the first semicolon BUT BEFORE the \\\\ signs. (This is CRITICAL as this line must be remmed out for the 571b to perform the \"fruit alignment\" rendering procedure required on all Hutzler banana slicers since the release of the Hutzler 300 series banana slicer. (EXCEPT 314a-d and any of the \"M300\" series military use field banana slicing units.)10) Scroll to line 14234, add a line and hit paste; this will add lines 371 - 1114 of the patch code.11) Hit close, then \"save edits.\"12) Re-open the patch file icon. Enable autorun. Close patch file.13) Re-open the patch file.14) After 20 or 30 seconds (while autorunning) a message window will appear with the message \"Hutzler 571b now installed.\"15) Select \"set default actions\".16) Click \"autodetect left/right fruit polarity\" (this will be a HUGE timesaver later, allowing for left/right handed fruit processing WITHOUT having to purchase the Hutzler 571C or utilizing the rug-drop technique mentioned in previous reviews.(FINALLY!!!!))17) Click \"enable onboard camera use\"; when the yellow warning window opens click \"allow.\" (You may have to disable any Norton software you have running at this point and retry; check the YouTube video.)18) Click \"save autodetect state\", then click save configuration state. (You can create a backup file at this point if you wish, I recommend this if you are planning to clone this drive or migrate this file to additional 571b banana slicing machines.)19) Re-boot machine.Its just that simple! You are now ready to use your Hutzler 571B banana slicer on a Windows 8 platform for both left and right hand polarity bananas! ENJOY!Note: The above instructions are intended for use on 64bit machines only!

Was about to throw it away when I realized that the banana slicer was shaped like a banana. I had been grasping bananas and pushing them through the device end first and was getting strange shaved banana pieces that were long and somewhat oval shaped, but varying widely in shape and size.  Then I noticed that the slicer housing was in a rough shape of a banana.  I had an epiphany and decided to try laying the skinned banana on the slicer so that its shape was congruent with the shape of the slicer and then pushing the banana \"sideways\" (vs. endwise) through the slicer.  This worked so much better and produced the nice, circular, cross-sectional slices that I was hoping to get.Ends up that this is a great product, but the lack of clear instructions led to wasting several bunches of bananas before figuring it on my own.  To help others avoid the same frustration I experienced, I decided to write down clear, easy to understand instructions:1. Remove the skin from the banana (I went through several bananas before realize that this didn't peel and slice)2. Lay the Slicer on a clean, planar, solid surface that is oriented so that a vector orthogonal to plane's surface is parallel to the local gravity vector.3. Lay the freshly peeled banana congruently, and in an analogue position, on the slicer surface that is on the antipodal side to the surface adjacent to aforementioned horizontal surfaceIMPORTANT!!!!! - ensure that the curve in the peeled banana lies in a parallel plane to the curve in the slicer.4. While holding the banana using several fingers placed along the apex ridge line of the banana, carefully pull the slicer upward  and parallel to a vector that is perpendicular to the aforementioned horizontal surface. Make sure that this motion is a pure translation without any measurable rotational components.  Apply pressure against the banana so that it remains inertial during the motion of the slicer.Following these simple instructions will ensure that your banana slicing efforts are immediately successful.","rating":4,"author":"True Rocker","date":"2013-01-04T22:00:00.000Z"}]}

It seems her unborn baby was craving a banana for breakfast.

How was she supposed to cut and eat this banana the Claw she wondered?  So began the process of trial and error.  The banana was ripe, so she was able to “claw” the fruit and bash it on the edge of the counter to get the peel to break open.  But then she dropped it on the kitchen floor on account of useless Claw, but was able to pick it up with her left hand.  After it was skinned, she attempted to use a steak knife (that she stole from a nearby five star steakhouse) with her left hand to slice it into equal 1/4” wide slices.  But her luck just couldn't improve—it was a right-handed knife! Being in a bit of an exhausted rage, she threw the banana into the a Magic Bullet and made a banana mash.

And, it's easy to remove the slices too ... sometimes, I can hold it on both ends and wiggle and the banana slices will just fall out. For the stubborn ones, just a light tap slicer end(s) on a hard surface, and out they pop.The slicer is HUGE, by the way, and might work even on plantains(???).  On the small-average sized banana, it takes a little maneuvering to place the huge cutter, and some slices will come out quite angled while the others will be uniformly rounded.

Anything that would save me a few extra minutes preparing endless meals would help me hold onto my sanity for just a little longer.  What I didn't count on was how impossible it became to prepare anything else which required individual slicing and cutting one piece at a time.  Suddenly cutting cheese, various fruits and vegetables became so taxing I found myself in tears and desperate for an answer.  I finally caved and started substituting bananas for everything else.  While the solution seemed to fix all my issues the rest of my family did not cope so well.  Instead of appreciating the quickness in which I prepared my daughters grilled banana sandwich I found her heaving in the garbage can.  My husband tells me his employees have lost all respect for him after watching him try to eat ham and banana sandwiches without retching.  And my son, who used to be my \"good eater\" is wasting away.  I've tried substituting boiled bananas for carrots, which while have always been a favorite of his, are the most time consuming and aggravating vegetables to cut.  But again he expresses his \"gratitude\" much the same way as my daughter, by retching in the nearest receptacle.  Now I find myself being investigated by child welfare for neglect, and they are running a battery of tests on my family members citing \"dangerously high levels of potassium\" and \"lacking in any other necessary nutrients\".  This product, which initially improved my life, has torn my family apart.  I should add however, I don't blame the product I blame my family.

You name the pill, I was probably on it. I was basically walking around life high as a kite on anti-depressants. Life was hard.You see, as a young child my mother never taught me how to slice a banana. I had to just ... eat the banana AS IS. This was very difficult for me. All my friends were eating peanut butter and sliced banana sandwiches, having fruit salad with sliced banana, simply enjoying the fruits of the sliced banana. I was living ignorantly in a world where everyone sliced bananas. I was constantly teased about eating bananas whole. I often went home and cried myself to sleep over the scrutiny of everyone around me. As a result, I grew a fear of the banana. I was diagnosed as having Bananaphobia. This is a highly researched phobia, and is basically unable to be cured. I hid myself from the world most of my teenage life due to Bananaphobia. I felt ... undesirable and lost.This continued until about 2 weeks, 3 hours and 57 minutes ago, when I purchased the Victorio Kitchen Products 571B Banana Slicer in attempt to feel better about myself. LET ME TELL YOU ...I am forever a changed woman. Now I hold my head high in confidence! I walk into a room and basically demand attention. I have never felt more beautiful in my life. I was changed that day ... and for the best I tell you, the BEST! Everyday I go to work, eating my sliced bananas, and I can tell people think I'm awesome. I see them out of the corner of my eyes ... just staring at me in pure envy, wishing they too, had a perfectly sliced banana. One man even thought I was so awesome, he proposed to me!! I don't know much about him ... but I knew he had good taste ... sooooo ... I married him! Together we eat sliced bananas, and dare people to taunt us.

In addition to slicing bananas, it could be used to prepare that nasty bully beef loaf in our rations.I can picture it clearly, as if it were just yesterday...There we were, anxiously waiting in the rain and mud for the signal to advance into no man's land.  Through the coils of barbed wire and across the field pocked with water-filled shell holes, we could barely see our objective - the enemy trenches.  Up and down the line, the order was relayed: \"Fix....Hutzlers!\"  Almost as one, we snapped our slicers onto the lugs below the barrels of our Enfields, and waited.  That was the worst time...waiting...some of us praying.There! The sound of the whistles and we were over the top, scrambling like rats to get through the wire and across that wretched field!  Somewhere off to the left a Maxim started chattering, and soon it was joined by the distinctive snap of Mannlicher rounds.  On we ran, fighting the muddy footing, cursing, screaming, slipping, closing...always closing...and then we were on them!Words cannot describe the effect our Hutzlers had upon the Hun.  I...I cannot speak of it plainly, even today, for it brings a cold pain to my chest.  See? Now my hands are trembling to think of that day...the look on their faces. But, for those of us who survived the crossing, the Huntzler proved to be the turning point, the edge that broke the stalemate along the front and ultimately led to the Armistice.There are few of us left today who remember that time.  We gather once a year to reminisce and perform a toast to those comrades who paid the ultimate price.  And we toast the Hutzler, for without it I am certain we all would have stayed in that god-forsaken muddy hell until it became our common grave.","rating":5,"author":"John Maki","date":"2012-12-12T22:00:00.000Z"}]}

After losing the third toe, I switched to the lesser known but still highly regarded sledgehammer approach. While this certainly worked, I think calling the result \"slices\" is a bit misleading at best. And then there was the fourth toe lost....What to do? My hacksaw couldn't make a dent in them, and child services put a stop to the 4 year old using the metal bandsaw even though the re-attachment surgery was completely successful! I came on Amazon to purchase an acetylene cutting torch, but I came across this product, and the rest is history!On to the performance: now when I hit the banana with the sledgehammer instead of turning into mush it is cleanly sliced into the perfect cereal topping. No more mush and floor dirt! Since I've switched to a smaller 8lb sledgehammer the banana slicer lasts for up to 3 times before I have to replace it!Cleanup couldn't be easier. All you need is something like a toothbrush, and in less than 5 minutes of careful scrubbing between each blade it is clean and ready for tomorrow. And if it broke, you just toss it in the trash and save yourself the time, though I always sleep a little better if spend a few minutes getting the worst bits out. Then you just fill up a bucket with water and ammonia, mop the floor to remove the remnants, and then dry it with paper towels so the kids don't slip and fall. Finally, run the sledgehammer under the sink to wash it off, then lightly oil it to prevent it from rusting.This is a miracle product that has changed our lives forever. I cannot imagine an easier way to prepare a banana for human consumption. Bananas used to be a luxury item, something we ate on special Sundays when we had the time to both prepare them and make the trip to the emergency room. Now, so long as I have a spare 10-15 minutes, it's banana time!  I've even started a little side business preparing bananas for the neighbors, which to be honest is more a labor of love. Once I get the 10 ton press I'll be able to scale this up into a money making operation, as I could probably slice 10-15 bananas at once. I dream of a future where any middle-class American has access to a well sliced banana.

Tears of gratitude flowed from my eyes as I sliced the much despised yellow fruit.  \"Shock\" is the only word that can describe the results as I stared in disbelief at the perfect slices.  Yes, I said \"PERFECT\" slices.

It is a marvel of modern science, and if onlyit could also peel the banana, I could completely prevent the loss of orphan limbs to belt sanders. Godbless you Hutzler. God bless us every one.","rating":5,"author":"FantasyFanatic","date":"2012-12-09T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2ICKEHZRETQPE","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ICKEHZRETQPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"This could have given my grandmother a few more years!","text":"I'm sitting here, bawling like a baby, after receiving my Hutzler Banana Slicer.  You see, my grandmother died 17 years ago.  For at least 20 years prior to her death, my grandma ate Corn Flakes with sliced bananas on it for breakfast every single morning.  On her deathbed, she grabbed my hand and said \"Barbara, if only....if only I hadn't had to slice those bananas every morning, I could have had a few more years!  Slicing those darn bananas took years off my life!  You--my brilliant granddaughter--you must invent something that will slice the bananas so as to give other seniors a few more years--years I wish I still had!  You must do it!\"Well, as I am still grieving the loss of my grandmother, I have been unable to work on inventing something to slice bananas.  Imagine my surprise to find that it had been invented--thus saving me the time-consuming process of designing, engineering, acquiring a patent, all of that stuff. Thank you Hutzler!I have ordered two cases of these wonderful items.  My parents will now have more time left...time they won't have to spend slicing bananas over their cereal.  I plan on ordering more of them to take to the senior villages around here and distributing them (I live in Florida, we have an overabundance or seniors down here).  Once I get the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the hands of every senior citizen in Florida, I will work on younger populations.  This product could, conceivably, add years to the average persons' lifespan.  It could also result in more money in Hutzler's pocket, as I am sure once folks start using the right-handed slicer, they will want to order the left-handed slicer.For years I have been searching for my mission in life.  Distributing the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer to senior citizens, I now believe, is my calling.  If I can save even ONE grandchild the grief I have experienced at my grandmother losing years--YEARS!!--of her life due to having to slice bananas then it will be worthwhile.","rating":5,"author":"Barbara A.

Too many cigarettes and not enough work.  Clients were as rare as hens teeth, these days.  It seemed word got out that I was getting sloppy. \"Mr banana fingers\", they called me behind my back.  \"He's losing his touch\", they'ed whisper.  But when you've sliced as many as i have you'd get soft too.  Fat chance I was retiring now. Not with a '57 convertible half way paid off and a tab at the banana stand on 4th that was well past its shelf life. I was a one punch palooka half way to loserville, smelling like cheap cologne and broken dreams.But then she walked in.  She was a knock out.  the kind of girl that made old men suck in their gut and young men puff out their chest.  \"We'll hello there sweetheart, the dentist office is next door\", I said with a smile.\"I'm not looking for the dentist\", she said.  \"I'm looking for Johnny Flynn Private Slicer.\"\"We'll you came to the right place\", I said, mustering up what I hoped was a look of confidence.  \"Tell me what's on your mind.\"The story she told would have turned the most jaded slicer green with banana envy.  It was a big job.  The biggest. And even though my gut was turning somersaults I knew I couldn't turn it down.  This was the kind of slicing gig that would make a hundred reputations or destroy a thousand more.Her father was the head of the Dole banana conglomerate and some Ivy League poindexter came up with the big idea to do the annual customer gala with a casino night theme.  But this time they were gunna use banana chips instead of poker chips.  These babies had to be stripped, sliced and dried to exact measurements if they were going to be handled by Dole's biggest clients.\"I heard you're the best\", she said.\"Was the best\", I thought.  \"Yeah, I've still got the chops. Watch this. I grabbed my number 7 knife and threw a banana in the air. I swung at it and missed it entirely.  My knife stabbed down through nothin' but air and dropped out of my hand on the table in front of me.  I watched the banana spin slowly as it fell fell fell and slap, like some miracle you read about in those dime store slicer mags, the banana landed on the knife blade and was cut cleanly in two.  My jaw dropped open in amazement and my eyes were big as saucers.\"Impressive\", she said.\"Impossible\", I thought.  \"Yep, impressive is my middle name.\", I stammered.She tossed her red hair back and said, \"You got the job. See you Saturday at eight.\"\"B... Buh... but, we haven't talked about my fee.She laughed and said as she walked to the door, \"Whatever your usual fee is, I'll pay triple.\"Then she added, \"Oh, and if you blow this gig you'll never work in this town again.\"And with a slam of the door she was gone.  I realized then she hadn't told me her name. That didn't matter.  Everyone knew who she was. It was splashed across the society pages every week.  \"Dole diva doles out dollars to the down and despondent\" or \"Lecherous love lorn Lothario leaves Linda Livingston livid\".  L. & L. but friends just called her Elle.\"You'll never work in this town again\".Those words echoed over and over in my head.  As I reached for my hat my hand was shaking.  But then, I looked down at the table and saw the miracle banana perfectly sliced.... an accident, or was it?  Maybe the big guy up stairs was gunna save my sorry heiner once again.  I said a quick thanks to my guardian slicer and headed home.  Once I got in bed doubt crashed into my head like a 500 lb gorilla on a sack of Dole's finest.  I wasn't gunna come out of this.  Not ol' Banana Fingers.  I needed help fast and I knew just where to get it.  Johnny Flynns mentor in this business was a crusty old slicer named Harvey Muldoon.  Long retired he learned the trade over seas cooking banana fritters and stew for the yanks during WWI.  If anyone could help me pull this off it was him.  I know it was late but I went over and told him everything--about the dame, the gig and the banana trick.  He sat their stone faced until I told him about the banana flip, miss and slice.  If it wasn't so late in the evening I would swear he shed a tiny tear.  He got up from his chair and stood there. And with a smile he said, \"I guess you're going to be needing this.\"  He dragged the paint chipped chair over to the corner of the room, got up on it.  Reaching up to the ceiling he pushed at a plank which moved out of the way.  He reached into the ceiling compartment and pulled out a box wrapped in an old World War I army issue banana sack.  Inside was a battered tin box.  With a look of immense pride he handed it to me like a father handing someone their new born to hold for the first time.  \"This saved my life\", he said as he carefully lifted the dented metal lid.  Inside was a hand cut form made of velvet and soft cotton and nestled in the middle was a strange looking device. Reverently he took it out and handed it to me.  \"Be careful now.  It's razor sharp.\"\"What is it\" I said.It's the Hutzler 571.  It's what gave me the speed and precision to feed thousands of doughboys a day with mess tins and steaming bowls of banana fritters, pudding and stew.I was intrigued but skeptical... until I saw it in action.  Shazam! It sliced bananas faster than Ricky Ricardo could smack a conga drum.\"I will take good care of it\", I said solemnly.\"You better. It's yours now.\", he said.I was overwhelmed. \"I don't know what to say.\"\"You can start with a simple thank you\" he said with a smirk.Come Saturday I was all ready.  I made a small leather holster for it so that I could pull it out at a moments notice.  I practiced my draw in front of the mirror day and night.  I can't say that the event went perfectly.  But I got the satisfaction of Elle saying I could slice her bananas any old time of the year.I found my confidence that day.  Thanks to some divine help and an old man's secret weapon I made it to the big banana leagues.  No more scraping around for the odd job. Now I named my fee and sliced my way across the banana circuit.  But still, with my fame and banana jet set status Linda Livingston was still out of my league.  Now when I read about her in the society section I save the article and place them in a folder in the large steel safe along with a battered tin box. When I see it I say a quick thanks to her for walking into my life and giving this old flatfoot a chance to start again.","rating":5,"author":"Freddie","date":"2013-01-25T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"RTM6IB0I4J6PI","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTM6IB0I4J6PI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"no more public fear","text":"Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer gave me the confidence to finally eat a banana in public.

I can recall as a boy growing in the Ozarks waking each cold morning to go  pick bananas from the local 7-11 with my Grandpa.  We would bring them home in a wicker basket.  He  lectured me like Polonius  on women, intimacy, bananas (occasionally interweaving all lessons at once).  We would arrive home to spend hours by the wood burning stove fighting off the winter's chill slicing bananas so uniform you could measure the snowfall in bananas - each hand made slice measuring precisely an inch.  Well thanks Hutzler. This is all gone now and my Grandpa has only his avocado scoop to live for. Another  \"slice\" of the American experience has become rotten from thoughtless technology.","rating":5,"author":"Amazon Customer","date":"2012-12-24T22:00:00.000Z"}]}

Some 20+ years ago I left everything and everybody behind and set out for the New World, the Land of Opportunity, where people go from dishwasher to millionaire.While I have done mountains of dishes ever since my arrival here, the $$$ millions are yet to come in. Every year I would go back to Germany over the holidays to visit friends and family, and with each passing year said people tried less and less to hide their pity for poor me, who would never account to much of anything in this lifetime. Well, last Christmas, all of that changed forever!Once again the family was gathered for a holiday celebration. First, everybody sat down for a delicious dinner. How festive everything was! Set on a precious Damask tablecloth, the best Meissner Porzellan adorned the table, framed by precious silverware. And when I say silverware, I mean it was made of real silver! Over the years it had come to my parents and me being seated at the kids' table so that the more successful kids could sit with the adults. We felt like pariahs. But this year, I could not help but smile throughout the five course dinner. My parents looked at me with concern on their faces - did the years of despair finally catch up with their child? Was their child going over the edge? I could have said something right then and there, but I held my tongue.....After dinner, the family gathered around the 20' Christmas tree. A circle of wrapped gifts was laid out around the tree and after singing the obligatory \"Silent Night, Holy Night\", everybody was participating in an orgy of tearing gift wrap. Only my parents sat on the sidelines, watching wistfully. An hour later, after everybody had opened all of their gifts, only one mysterious package was left under the tree. The confusion was quite grand as there was no \"from, to\" sticker on the gift. Silence befell the room as I, with my head held high, walked over to the tree, picked up the package and gently laid it into the withered hands of my dear old mother. She looked at me somewhat puzzled, but after I gave her a confirming nod, her trembling hands proceeded to open the gift. My father, fearing the worst (another pair of gloves? a scarf?), made a move to take the gift out of mother's hands, but one look into my confident eyes, and he froze.By the time my mother had removed the gift wrap, everybody had gathered around her. People held their breath as the last piece of paper came off. You could hear a pin drop as mother opened the box! You could hear Aunt Gretchen drop as she fainted when my mother pulled out...... THE HUTZLER 571! A collective gasp went through the room - a HUTZLER 571!!! As long as I shall live I will never forget how my mother looked up at me, tears of joy and pride running over her dear wrinkled old face. My father was speechless, almost choking on tears, he shook my hand while his other hand firmly grasped my shoulder, and as his piercing eyes looked into mine I could see nothing but pride in them. Never have I seen my parents prouder and happier in their whole life! Mother held up the Hutzler 571 for everybody to see and it emitted a blinding golden glow. Gifts that my relatives had held clutched in their hands until now fell to the floor. What are diamond earrings and cufflinks compared to the blinding beauty of the Hutzler 571??? What good is that new BMW in the driveway compared to the ultimate slicing machine??? Nothing, I tell you, nothing!!!Slowly, my mother rose from her seat, and much like Moses had parted the sea, she parted the silent crowd with the Hutzler 571. My father followed, beaming with pride. As mother made her way to the grown-up table, the crowd started to regain movement. The male relatives tripped over each other in their efforts to pull chairs out for my my parents. Finally, my parents were seated at the head of the table, and after their nod of approval, the crowd sat down at the table with them. What can I tell you, it was the best Christmas ever! Champagne corks popped, my parents laughed, and amidst the joy tiny Timotheus shouted out \"God bless us, each and every one of us!\".And blessed all of them will be. Next Christmas, I will go back to Germany with another Hutzler 571 in my carry-on luggage. Yes, one of my many relatives will be the lucky recipient of another Hutzler 571. Due to strict export regulations I can only take one a year out of the country. I could, legally, take several Fox Run Banana Slicers out of the country, but please, c'mon now, they are COMPLETELY different! I mean, just look for yourself, do a side-by-side comparison! Who are they trying to fool?As for my parents, who knows what the future will hold for them...  Maybe the \"Chef'n Strawberry Slicester Hand-Held Strawberry Slicer\", the \"Progressive International Compact Egg Slicer\", or gasp, maybe even the \"Fox Run Butter Spreader Stick\"!?!?
