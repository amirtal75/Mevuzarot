R367OTNJ8I36FS -@@@@@@@- I can't say much about this except that it was a gift for a great granddaughter.  My granddaughter tells me that she reads this to her eighteen month old daughter, and they both enjoy it enough to share it over and over again.  I read it too and found it a fun story. -@@@@@@@- 5 -@@@@@@@- https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R367OTNJ8I36FS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604
RJ62XWHGDIF7 -@@@@@@@- As soon as I got this package, I gave it to my 18 month old son to open and he made me read it to him about a dozen times. He loves it! He's obsessed with his belly button, so this is the perfect book for him. He's also obsessed with peek-a-boo, so he loves lifting the flaps. It was a definite hit! -@@@@@@@- 5 -@@@@@@@- https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ62XWHGDIF7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604
R1L8O7RM8DD6J3 -@@@@@@@- The book is sturdy and well made. My baby likes to carry her books around and they are routinely dropped. It has held up really well. She loves the flaps and finding the hands, feet, etc. My only critique is that the body parts that are highlighted are the smallest item on the whole page. As a visual representation for teaching a child it seems weird that the focal points are not scaled to be more familiarly identifiable. -@@@@@@@- 4 -@@@@@@@- https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1L8O7RM8DD6J3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604

R33DK4T6EHUIHX -@@@@@@@- Does a nice job of showing your child where different body parts are in a cute manner.  However, my one year old likes to lift the flaps himself and I also think this is a great way for him to be part of the story too.  The problem with this book is the flaps covering the different body parts are very flimsy and very easily ruined.  Compared to some other books out there, this one doesn't live up to expectations.  Youngsters are still figuring out motor skills and are anything but delicate at this stage.  I appreciate books that are made to last more than a couple reads... -@@@@@@@- 3 -@@@@@@@- https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33DK4T6EHUIHX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604

R3MRIY8FUDOYHU -@@@@@@@- My almost 2 year old son loves the Katz books. We have the Beach Ball book, the Zoom Zoom book, and this one, so far, but I'm sure we'll get more. My son really likes this one, though I think he prefers the Beach Ball bookֲ Where Is Baby's Beach Ball?: A Lift-the-Flap Book (Karen Katz Lift-the-Flap Books)ֲ best, but all the Katz books are top faves. -@@@@@@@- 5 -@@@@@@@- https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MRIY8FUDOYHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604

RZYFWT276TO8K -@@@@@@@- This book It's just "ok",the idea is very nice and the images are cute ,but it has very few pages(just 6 flaps).it's not expensive,so I should know from the beginning why..but doing some research on line I could find something better paying the same.my mistake trusting the amazing reviews! -@@@@@@@- 3 -@@@@@@@- https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZYFWT276TO8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604

R3QKBFRYMJTRC8 -@@@@@@@- its a cute book but my 2year old son wasn't as enthralled as some of the other reviewer's kids. Oh well, that's not the book's fault. Kids can be picky. He still likes the book, but it doesn't hold his attention all the way through the book (and it's very short). It's ok, but I wouldn't pay full price for it and glad I didn't. -@@@@@@@- 3 -@@@@@@@- https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QKBFRYMJTRC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604

R20C15AL3RZNFK -@@@@@@@- My son loves books but he isn't in to this one so much. I got it because it had so many great reviews.
