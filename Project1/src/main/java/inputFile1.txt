He loves it! He's obsessed with his belly button, so this is the perfect book for him. He's also obsessed with peek-a-boo, so he loves lifting the flaps.

My baby likes to carry her books around and they are routinely dropped. It has held up really well. She loves the flaps and finding the hands, feet, etc. My only critique is that the body parts that are highlighted are the smallest item on the whole page. As a visual representation for teaching a child it seems weird that the focal points are not scaled to be more familiarly identifiable.","rating":4,"author":"reviewer","date":"2016-04-28T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"RGMH5ROASTBS8","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGMH5ROASTBS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"Five Stars","text":"Well-made children's book that an child will love.","rating":5,"author":"Andrea Gates","date":"2017-02-10T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"RW6ORU2M3C461","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW6ORU2M3C461/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"Great book for babes and toddlers","text":"I bought this book for a newborn.

However, my one year old likes to lift the flaps himself and I also think this is a great way for him to be part of the story too.  The problem with this book is the flaps covering the different body parts are very flimsy and very easily ruined.  Compared to some other books out there, this one doesn't live up to expectations.  Youngsters are still figuring out motor skills and are anything but delicate at this stage.  I appreciate books that are made to last more than a couple reads...","rating":3,"author":"Daddy D","date":"2014-03-14T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R3DHV2T9Q991V7","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DHV2T9Q991V7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"Five Stars","text":"Very cute!","rating":5,"author":"Eileen M.","date":"2017-04-28T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R3MRIY8FUDOYHU","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MRIY8FUDOYHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"love all the Karen Katz books!","text":"My almost 2 year old son loves the Katz books.
