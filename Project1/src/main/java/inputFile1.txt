The problem with this book is the flaps covering the different body parts are very flimsy and very easily ruined.  Compared to some other books out there, this one doesn't live up to expectations.  Youngsters are still figuring out motor skills and are anything but delicate at this stage.

The only thing I'd suggest is to watch out for little hands trying to rip the \"flap\" off. The pages are thick and nearly impossible to tear, but the \"flap\" can be torn off by a determined Little One. However, it's nothing a little double-sided tape can't fix.

I also, obviously like that it is a lift the flap book, because they engage my son for so long. One of the reasons I chose this particular book is because it addresses body parts and I thought it would be helpful when learning those body parts.What I don't like:Quality, quality, quality! We own several board books, but this one isn't nearly as nice as many others we own and have seen. He is 19 moths at the time of writing this and we have had it for about 6 months now and it has not held up nearly as well as the other lift the flap books we own, and he plays with this one far less. He loves his books and isn't very rough with them, so this is one of the few books we have that are damaged. The pages are very thin compared to literally every other board book we own, and the flaps are extremely flimsy and got bent during the first use.Overall, we like this book, but if I could go back in time I would choose a different book. It has not been a hit for us and is a bit disappointing. I would have given it 4 stars (maybe 5) if the quality was better.","rating":3,"author":"Ashley","date":"2015-12-02T22:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R3UMDZ3JH2JJF8","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UMDZ3JH2JJF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0689835604","title":"Her favorite book","text":"Baby's favorite book and she's pulled out almost all the pages lol.

Colorful images and the fun lift-the-flap pages had our baby (and even her 4 year old big sister) giggling along in no time. The book is just the right size to hold in your hands while holding your little one. The only draw back is making sure the flaps don't get torn.

This was the first book he actually loved and engaged with. We read through this book with him daily. He quickly grasped the concept of \"Where is ...\" and was excited when the flaps where lifted to reveal the item. I noticed that he also quickly translated it to things in his surroundings. When asked where is Dada etc, he would look in the direction of the person or item long before \"they\", meaning the experts, said he should. He is now 13 months old and still loves the book. Ever since he could walk and multitask, it surprised us that he would take this book up and walk to either his Dad or me so we could read it to him. Needless to say, it's pretty worn at this stage. If there is a less than positive remark I can make is that, although it's a board book, my little guy found a way to rip most of the flaps off. There is tape on every page :-) Not so sure if they could make it any sturdier though. Love this book!!! Definitely get it for your little one.","rating":5,"author":"kytuh utytgyuh","date":"2014-01-19T22:00:00.000Z"}]}

However, because I like the images of this book I still give it four stars. But one of the flaps is long gone. I purchased this together with \"Dear Zoo\" and in comparison between the two books is like night and day. \"Dear Zoo\" has held up very nicely (also much beloved by my son) because the flaps are made of carton-like paper.
